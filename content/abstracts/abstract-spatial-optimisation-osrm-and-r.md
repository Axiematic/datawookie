	Spatial Optimisation with OSRM and R
	</div>
	<div class="abstract">
		Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) is a high-performance routing engine for calculating the shortest paths through a road network. These calculations are available via Google Maps. However, queries against a local OSRM server are orders of magnitude faster than Google Maps.

		The osrm package for R exposes these routing data to a wide range of potential applications.

		In this talk I'll show how to easily spin up and provision an OSRM server and use it to solve some interesting spatial optimisation problems in R.

		R packages: [osrm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osrm/index.html), [gaoptim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gaoptim/index.html).
