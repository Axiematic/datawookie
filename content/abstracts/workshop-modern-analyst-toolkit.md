---

FIND A BETTER NAME!!

## Training Objectives

The course covers a selection of analytical skills and tools which are essential to the modern analyst. It will be intensive and practical, bringing you up to date with current technologies and preparing them to deliver value immediately and in the future.

If you want to expand or update your skills and boost your productivity then this four-day course is for you!

You will learn:

- How to perform a range of analyses in a spreadsheet.
- How to interact with a database using SQL.
- How to use R for Data Preparation and Machine Learning.
- How to use Python for Deep Learning.

R and Python are both indispensible tools for the modern analyst. We'll be looking at a range of features in each language and focusing on the domains in which each excels.

##  Format

Each topic is presented on a distinct day. Each day will begin with an introduction to the topic and then proceed to more advnaced material. Individual and group exercises will be used to ensure hands-on engagement with the material.

The depth of coverage on each of the topics will be enough to ensure that you can be immediately productive when you get back to work.

## What You 

### Hardware

You will need to bring along your own laptop.

### Software

You will only need a recent version of Chrome or Firefox. To ensure maximum productivity we'll be using online coding environments, so that we're all working with exactly the same versions of the software. More time for learning, less time spent solving computer problems!

However, we also want you to have the software set up on your own machines and we're very happy to help you trouble-shoot the installations.

## What You'll Get

- Some light pre-reading material.
- Course notes.
- Annotated recipes for a range of analyses.
- Rrefreshments and lunch.
- Access to a shared online space where we'll paste snippets of code and you can post questions.
- Exposure and understanding to a curated selection of Data Science technologies.
- Assistance with installing the software onto your laptop.
