To the uninitiated Docker can seem like a frightening beast. But it's not really all that scary. Taming this animal will allow you to adopt a selection of strategies for streamlining the way that you compute.

This talk will cover the following topics:

- What is Docker and why should I care?
- Images and Containers
- Building your first image
- Launching your first container
- Interacting with live containers
- <code>Dockerfile</code> syntax
- Sharing data with a container
- Exposing ports from a container
- Orchestrating multiple containers

These concepts will be stepping stones to building and deploying a simple app with a MySQL data store and served by NGINX. However they also act as a gateway to exploring the wide range of other functionality available through Docker.
