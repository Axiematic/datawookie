	Parallel Processing in R
	</div>
	<div class="abstract">
It’s a pretty safe bet that the computer you’re running R on has multiple cores. Yet R is single threaded. So all of that extra compute power is sitting dormant.

How to exploit the full capabilities of your hardware? In this talk I’ll look at ways to easily convert your existing R code to run in parallel across multiple cores. Minor changes to your code can result in a massive increase in computing power!
