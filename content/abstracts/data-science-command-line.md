R and Python are phenomenal tools for Data Science. But you can achieve a lot using simple command line tools too. And sometimes doing pre-processing on the command line can make your work in R or Python more efficient.

- Downloading data (`wget` and `curl`)
- Hitting an API (`curl` again)
- Manipulating CSV ([csvkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and `awk`)
- Working with text (`grep`, `tr` and `sed`)
- Sorting and deduplication (`sort` and `uniq`)
- Scripts: More than a one-liner
  - Iteration
  - Parallel execution
- Handling dependencies (`make`)
