	Deploying a Plumber API with Docker
	</div>
	<div class="abstract">
		Plumber makes it possible to easily transform your R functions into an API. Developing and testing the API locally is simple, but deploying it can be more of a challenge. Docker provides just what you need to ensure that the API is launched in a well defined, stable and isolated environment. These are some of the handiest tools to have in your toolbox!

		This short talk will show how to

		whip up a quick API by merely decorating your existing R code with comments, then
		write a simple Dockerfile to provide a runtime environment and finally
		deploy the API in the cloud.

		All of this in the timeframe of a lightning talk. Booya!
