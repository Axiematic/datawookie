Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer a bewildering array of Cloud options. I'll be looking at them from the perspective of a Data Scientist. In this domain there are a number of key features of AWS which can result in significant leaps in productivity. This is how you can get started.

I'll be focusing on three specific topics: compute, storage and database. Specifically I'll talk about the following:

- An overview of AWS
- Using S3 for scalable storage
- Setting up a RDS database
- Creating an EC2 instance
- Connecting to the instance using SSH
- Adding volumes, provisioning and customising the instance

With this knowledge in place you'll be empowered to shift a lot of your work from your local machine onto the Cloud.
