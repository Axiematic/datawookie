Take the Tedium out of Reporting
Let C3PO do your Reporting

What does your reporting workflow look like?

I'll bet it's something like this:

- load data into Excel;
- manually merge data from multiple sheets and tabs;
- create a few pivot tables;
- grind out some figures;
- open a Word document;
- copy tables from Excel;
- copy figures from Excel;
- manually tweak formatting of tables and figures;
- add document title and section headings;
- export to PDF;
- attach PDF to an email and send.

And then the next month (or, heaven forbid, the next week or day!) you repeat the same mundane process over again.

Generating reports by hand is tedious and error-prone. In this tutorial I'll demonstrate a compelling alternative: automated reporting. Using markdown and simple scripts it's possible to build robust automated systems which will quietly and reliably build and disseminate your reports, leaving you to focus on the interesting and dynamic parts of your business.

Reclaim your lunch hour: use automated reporting for seamless communication with your team and stakeholders.
