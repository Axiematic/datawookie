Docker sounds cool, but it's also a little daunting. So many new terms and command line options.

However, getting started with Docker can be simple and rewarding, provided that you choose your starter projects well. I will demonstrate three simple and useful starter projects:

- a static web site with Hugo and NGINX;
- an OpenVPN server; and
- an optimal routing API with OSRM.

I'll provide detailed recipes so that you can DIY.
