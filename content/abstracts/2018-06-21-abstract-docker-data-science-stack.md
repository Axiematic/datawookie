Often a Data Science problem is just too big to run on your trusty, sticker-adorned laptop. Pages are thrashing. CPUs are maxed out. Heat sink is on the brink.

You need to give your hardware a break. Shift the problem to the Cloud.
Simply spin up a VM, provision it with the required software and off you go!

However, using traditional techniques to equip a VM can be a time consuming and laborious process. Docker makes it simple and easy to assemble a Data Science stack.

In this talk I will demonstrate how to quickly and easily equip a VM with a Data Science stack consisting of the following indispensable tools:

- a database (either PostgreSQL, MySQL or Redis)
- Python (and a selection of useful modules)
- R (and a collection of handy libraries)
- RStudio
- Jupyter
- Shiny
- Plumber and
- Spark.

With that collection of tools at your disposal and a decent piece of (virtual) iron, there are few problems too big to solve

Finally, I'll  how a relatively large and challenging data task can be launched with ease.
