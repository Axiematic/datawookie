	<div class="abstract">
		Deploying a Shiny App is not an onerous process. You need to jump through some hoops to make it happen though:

		- provision a machine with R
		- install the `shiny` package
		- install the Shiny server (making sure that it starts automatically at boot).

		If you're comfortable working on the command line then this should be a walk in the park. It's still time consuming though.

		THIS NEEDS TO BE FINISHED!
