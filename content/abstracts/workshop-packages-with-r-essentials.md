title: "Building Packages with R: The Essentials"
---

If you work with R then it's very likely that you've installed packages from CRAN or GitHub, and are using those packages as part of your regular workflow. Where do those packages come from? Well, people like you write them. Why? Because a package makes a collection of functions easier to share and simpler to maintain. Wrapping functions up in a package also boosts efficiency, saving time and making results more robust and reproducible.

You might think that only the R cognoscenti create packages. Not true. Building a package is useful and achievable regardless of your level of R experience. In this workshop we'll demystify the process of creating a package, using builtin functionality in RStudio as well as the `devtools` and `usethis` packages.

1. Why build packages?
2. What goes into a package?
3. Creating the package structure
4. Adding functions
5. Adding data
6. Documentation
7. Tests
8. Case study: The `elliptical` package
9. Project: (one of the following options)

    - country codes
    - email addresses
    - great circle
