In the realm of the Tidyverse, there are functions which are always in the spotlight. These are the titans: well known, frequently used and virtually indispensable.

There are other, lesser-known functions which stand quietly in the shadows. Unacknowledged, somewhat obscure and almost forgotten. Waiting for their moment to shine.

I'll talk about five of these Unsung Heroes of the Tidyverse, singing their praises and showing you how they can help to defeat your next Data Science dragon.




All of the useful (but niche) functions in the tidyverse, the unappreciated and lesser known gems.
