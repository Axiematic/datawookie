Title: Unsung Heroes of the Tidyverse

In the realm of the Tidyverse, there are functions which are always in the spotlight. These are the titans: well known and loved, frequently invoked and virtually indispensable.

There are other, lesser-known functions which stand quietly in the shadows. Unacknowledged, somewhat obscure and almost forgotten. Waiting for their moment to shine.

I'll talk about five of these Unsung Heroes of the Tidyverse, lauding their virtues and showing how they can help you succeed on your next Data Science quest.





All of the useful (but niche) functions in the tidyverse, the unappreciated and lesser known gems.
