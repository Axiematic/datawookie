There is a vigorous debate raging about R or Python for Data Science. This, more than any other issue, can polarise the Data Science community.

There are strong arguments to be made in favour of either platform. R is steeped in Academia. It has an enormous selection of packages enabling a broad range of analyses. It excels as a research tool, but can be slow and memory hungry. Python, by contrast, is more pervasive in industry. It has robust packages specific to Data Science and many others supporting a plethora of diverse applications. It is efficient and robust in production. There are many other features which differentiate the two languages.

I will present a balanced, non-partisan view of the relative merits of R and Python, making some suggestions about which would be the best choice in various situations. I will also explore ways in which the two languages can be used together, thereby leveraging the strengths of each.

This will be a lightly technical talk, helpful to anybody contemplating a move into Data Science.
