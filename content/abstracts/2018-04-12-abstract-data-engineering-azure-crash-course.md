There's been a lot of hype around Data Science. A Data Scientist will use statistics and Machine Learning to extract information from a volume of data.

However, everything a Data Scientist does would be impossible without access to data. And that's where Data Engineering comes into the picture. Data Engineers make it possible for Data Scientists to do their jobs effectively!

A Data Engineer will gather data, do batch or real-time processing, store the data in an appropriate format and then make it available via an API so that a Data Scientist can easily access it.

Azure provides a selection of Data Engineering tools. In this talk I will give a high level overview of those tools and a short introduction to each, which will provide you with enough information to get started. Specifically I'll be looking at the following:

- **Data Lake** - Storage for raw data with various levels of structure.
- **SQL Data Warehouse** - Storage for processed and structured data.
- **Data Factory** - Data integration service with a variety of source connectors, enabling the creation of pipelines to efficiently transform data.
