A conference is an opportunity for people to gather in one place and share their enthusiasm about a specific topic. As a conference organiser you're responsible for ensuring that everybody has the best experience possible.

Before embarking on the long and adruous journey of organising a conference, be sure to ask yourself one critical question: Do I really want to do this? Because it's a big responsibility and a massive commitment (in terms of time, sleep and finances!). However, should you choose to accept the role then you can look forward to an incredibly fulfilling experience.

## Start Early

You should start the wheels moving at least six to eight months before the planned conference date.

Here's an example timeline:

- FOO
- BAR
- ZAP

## Choose a Theme or Topic

You don't want your conference to be too general. But, at the same time, you don't want it to be too specific. You want to be both inclusive and exclusive at the same time. Tough ask! You need to strike the sweet spot somewhere between those two extremes.

Things to consider when choosing a theme:

- are suitable feature speakers available?
- will people be interested in attending?
- will people be interested in speaking?
- will it be appealing to sponsors?

Doing some research will pay off. You should try to validate the need for this kind of conference before you consider hosting it. 

## Formulate a Mission Statement



## Choose a Name

Be sure that you can secure an appropriate URL and Twitter handle.

## Gather a Committee

There's a lot of work associated with a conference. So, unless you have a lot of time on your hands, it's going to be vital to have other people to help you. Furthermore, it's always helpful to be able to discuss ideas and get objective feedback.

Although ideally you want the committee to be somewhat democratic, somebody has to be responsible to making the tough choices. That would be the conference coordinator (probably you!).

How many people do you need on the committee?

I like to divide up the responsibilities into portfolios. These might include:

- programme
- sponsors
- venue
- catering
- ticketing
- web site
- social media
- publicity and
- administration.

You might experience the sense of a loss of control. That's okay. If you choose the people on your committee carefully then you can trust them to do a good job. Emphasise that if there are any important decisions to be made then you need to be consulted.

## Keep Notes

It's not unlikely that you'll do this again. So keep notes along the way. These will help you next time round.

## Location and Dates

Considerations when choosing dates:

- when are school and university holidays?
- when are other similar conferences scheduled?
- when are other large events scheduled?

These can have an impact on the availability and cost of flights and accommodation as well as whether or not speakers and attendees are already committed.

Ideally you'll want to select a date that's around six months in the future. That will give you a reasonable chance that most people will not already be committed.

An associated decision is the duration of the conference. Will it be a single day? Two, three or five days? Depends on how many speakers you think you'll have and the depth and breadth of the presentations.

Having a conference over a weekend is not ideal since the majority of people will consider a conference as part of their job. It makes sense, however, to try and schedule it for the end of the week because people might try to stay behind after the conference, leveraging the travel opportunity.

Where? It's easiest to organise a conference close to where you live. However, sometimes this is just not possible. Find a place that's

- easily accessible
- has good transportation infrastructure
- has ample (and afforable) accommodation and
- that people actually want to visit!

## Find a Venue

A suitable venue needs to have the following attributes:

- able to accommodate the projected number of attendees;
- proximity to hotels and airports;
- accessability via public transport;
- parking.

Options:

- convention centre (can be expensive but will have everything that you need);
- hotel with conference facilities (catering and accommodation are sorted!);
- universtity or school campus.

If it's going to be a relatively small conference then it's worthwhile looking at companies which have their own auditoriums.

Considerations in choosing a venue:

- size
- location (proximity to accommdation and transport)
- catering
- technical facilities.

## Find Sponsors

This factors directly into the next point: constructing a budget.

Levels and Benefits.

## Budget!

The scope of what you can do at a conference is largely determined by how much money you will have at your disposal. Do not leave this to chance. Carefully work out a budget.

How to estimate income?

Sources of income might include:

- ticket sales and
- sponsorships.

It's impossible to know how many people will attend in advance. But you can probably make a reasonable guess. It might make sense to explore a few different ticket sale scenarios, from minimal to massive.

How to estimate expenses?

There will be numerous expenses, but these are probably the most important:

- venue hire
- catering
- speaker transport
- speaker accommodation
- goodie bags
- conference shirts
- name tags

## Sell Tickets

It's no unreasonable to price the tickets such that they at least cover the costs of any conference meals and refreshments.

It's worth considering offering free entrance to the conference for people who are presenting.

Early Bird and Student tickets.

- Quicket
- EventBrite

## Meals and Refreshments

It's important to cater for people with specific dietary requirements. If possible you should record this information at the time of ticket sale. Otherwise send a questionnaire around to attendees. You might like to find out some other information (like t-shirt sizes) at the same time. 

It's worthwhile exploring a range of options for food. Solicit quotes from a number of potential providers.

It can save you a lot of hassle if you can find somebody who will cater for both lunches and tea/coffee breaks.

## Web Site, Social Media and Publicity

At the very minimum the web site should include:

- date and time
- location
- names of keynote speakers

- Lanyrd

## Get (and Keep) Organised

There's an abundance of information associated with a conference. Try to keep it all in one (or a few) spreadsheets. Being able to lay your hands on this information quickly and easily is going to make your life a lot easier.

## Things to Organise


### Technical Support

It will really pay to have some competent technical support available on the day to sort out problems with projectors, WiFi and any of the countless other pieces of hardware and software that can become recalcitrant at the most inconvenient time.

Many venues will have their own technical support available. If this comes at a premium then it will be money well spent. You don't want some technical gremlin to derail your entire conference!

### Lanyards and/or Name Tags

## Dry Run

On the day before the conference you should visit the venue and walk through all aspects of the conference to make sure that there's nothing you've forgotten or overlooked.

## Speakers

Considerations when selecting speakers:

- aim for diversity (junior and senior; gender balance)

A good set of speakers the core of any successful conference. Since they can either make or break your conference, it makes sense to look after them well. Here are some things you can do:

- help them with their travel and accommodation arrangements;
- organise their transport to and from the airport;

Although speakers are the life blood of your conference, you'll also need to harass and cajole them from time to time in order to get what you need (updated titles, abstracts, headshots). You might feel that you are overcommunicating with them, but don't sweat it: they know what they signed up for. And they know that you are doing this for their own good (and for the good of the event).

## Session Chairs

Session chairs should be briefed about what you expect.

You should also have somebody who is responsible for keeping track of times. The session chair can probably do this too. You should provide a set of cards which can be held up to indicate when there's 5, 2 or 1 minute to go in a speaker's allocated slot.

## Contents

### Keynote Speakers

Having a few big name keynote speakers will give your event credibility.

### Parallel Sessions

### Programme Options

- Workshop
- Tutorial
- Standard Talk (can be anything from 20 minutes to 1 hour)
- Lightning Talk (typically 5 minutes)
- Discussions

### Session Duration

### Begin and End with a Bang

You don't want your conference to simply fizzle out. So save a good talk for the end. This will encourage people to stay for the whole event. It will also ensure that they leave on a high note.

### Call for Papers

You'll probably have a list of people who you want to speak at your conference. You should reach out to them directly (by email or phone), tell them that you'd like them to speak and ask them to submit a proposal.

- [PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/)
- [Ex Ordo](https://www.exordo.com/)

## Month Before the Event

- Accept or reject proposals.
- Construct the programme.
- Update the web site with the list of speakers and programme.

### Backup Plans

What are you going to do if one (or more!) of your speakers cancels? Or just fails to arrive on the day? If you can then it's helpful to have a few backup speakers available who are ready (and willing) to jump on the opportunity to fill a gap in the programme.

## Week Before the Event

- If you are running the conference from a single computer, gather presentation material so that it can all be uploaded before you start. Give your speakers ample notive that you'll need their presentations before the event!

## On the Day

## Abstract Submission

- https://sessionize.com/

## Types of Talk

- standard talk
- lightning talk
- 30 second talk about poster

The 30 second poster talks are a great way for people to advertise the contents of their poster. Ideally you should pack a bunch of these into a single session and have them presented with a high tempo.

## Opening

## Closing

You need to thank the following people:

- the sponsors
- the keynote speakers (possibly hand them some sort of gift)
- the rest of the speakers
- the organising committee.
