	<p>TL;DR Building the ultimate runners' portal using Django, D3 and R.</p>

    <p>Runners enjoy running. Obviously! They're also somewhat obsessed with statistics: weekly mileage, marathon times, resting heart rate, medal count... Back in the day these would be recorded by hand in a dog-eared logbook. But we're too sophisticated for that now.</p>

    <p>Services like Strava allow a runner to track their training statistics online and easily make comparisons with their running mates. However, the ultimate test of a runner is the race. And race statistics are distributed across a variety of sites on the internet. There's no single resource.</p>

    <p>Wouldn't it be handy if all of those results were aggregated in one place? A runner could then see a consolidated picture of their racing prowess. It'd be cool if it was augmented with responsive visualisations and predictive models.</p>

    <p>I'll be talking about an ambitious project to carefully synthesise those distributed race statistics, using R for scraping and modeling, Django for data management and presentation, and D3 for visualisation.</p>

    <p>I'll also discuss the models that I've built using this meticulously validated set of data and the intriguing things that they've revealed about that curious animal, the Long Distance Runner.</p>
