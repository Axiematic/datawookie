I put in a proposal to host a R Saturday [[satRday](https://github.com/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal)] in Cape Town next year. The R Consortium has committed to funding three of these events: one will be in Hungary, another will be somewhere in the USA and the third will be elsewhere in the world. The voting has opened for the location of these events.
