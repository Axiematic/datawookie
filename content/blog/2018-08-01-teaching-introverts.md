Hey guys

Great to chat today!

As discussed, this is a brilliant book to read generally, and it includes info on teaching tips and hints: Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, by Susan Cain

As an introvert myself, I really resonated with it and it helped my teaching a lot, since a typical class will have c. 30% introverts. They might really be enjoying class, but it's disconcerting for the teaching team if they don't contribute. 

Can't seem to find a good way to share the content with you - sorry! You can get at Exclusives or on Kindle. 

But there is a TED Talk https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts
And a website https://www.quietrev.com/

Cheers

...'Teachers can take specific actions in order to support the introverted students in their classroom. Redefine participation so that it is not just about talking, but also about active listening, reflection, elaboration, etc. Provide rehearsal/preparation time, so that introverts are able to consider what they might contribute to a small-group or whole-class conversation. Use small groups so that introverts can develop greater comfort levels and confidence. But structure them carefully based on cooperative learning principles. Provide permission NOT to speak in order to reduce anxiety and increase focused participation. Teach all students about personality differences in order to understand both self and others better. Communicate clearly that introversion is not a “problem” to be fixed, but a unique difference to be valued and welcomed'...
