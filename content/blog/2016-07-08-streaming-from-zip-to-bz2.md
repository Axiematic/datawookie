I've got a massive bunch of zip archives, each of which contains only a single file. And the name of the enclosed file varies. Dealing with these data is painful.

It'd be a lot more convenient if the files were compressed with `gzip` or `bzip2` and had a consistent naming convention. How would you go about making that conversion without actually unpacking the zip archive, finding the name of the enclosed file and then recompressing? Enter `funzip`.

To illustrate, first we create a zip archive with a single file.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ ls -l foo.txt
-rw-rw-r- 1 user user 2311 Jul 8 14:06 foo.txt
$ zip foo.zip foo.txt
  adding: foo.txt (deflated 62%)
$ ls -l foo.zip
-rw-rw-r- 1 user user 1031 Jul 8 14:06 foo.zip
{{< / highlight >}}

Then extract the single file to standard output using `funzip` and pipe the results through `bzip2`.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ funzip foo.zip | bzip2 >foo.bz2
$ ls -l foo.bz2
-rw-rw-r- 1 user user 924 Jul 8 14:06 foo.bz2
{{< / highlight >}}

Another, more robust, approach is to simply use `unzip` with `-c` (extract to stdout) and `-qq` (be super quiet).

{{< highlight bash >}}
unzip -qq -c foo.zip | bzip2 >foo.bz2
{{< / highlight >}}

Voila!
