It looks likes one of the suspect runners from my previous posts cheated again in this year's Comrades Marathon. <!-- more --> Brad Brown has published evidence that the runner in question, Kitty Chutergon (race number 25058), had another athlete running with his number for most of the race. This is a change in strategy from last year, where he appears to have been assisted along the route, having missed the timing mats at Camperdown and Polly Shortts.
