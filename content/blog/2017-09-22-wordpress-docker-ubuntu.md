title: Quick Wordpress Install with Docker
---

I've just put together a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) site for my older daughter. It's hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and all of the infrastructure is handled with Docker. This post describes the steps in the (easy) install process.

<!--more-->

The first thing that you need to do is [install Docker]({{< relref "2017-09-14-installing-docker-ubuntu.md" >}}). With that in place it's a simple matter to instantiate a couple of images and the whole thing is up an running.

## MySQL Docker Container

Wordpress stores content in a MySQL database. Since we want to persist that data beyond the lifespan of a Docker container we should store the data on the host.
First create a folder for the database data.

{{< highlight bash >}}
mkdir ~/mysql-data
{{< /highlight >}}

Next create a (temporary) environment variable to store the MySQL `root` user password. This is not really necessary, but it made my life easier.

{{< highlight bash >}}
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="PercoreggIn2"
{{< /highlight >}}

Now launch an instance of the [MySQL Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/). Note that the folder created above is listed as a volume and linked to the folder `/var/lib/mysql` on the container.

{{< highlight bash >}}
docker run --name mysql \
  -v ~/mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD \
  -d mysql:latest
{{< /highlight >}}

Check that the container is up and running.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID IMAGE            COMMAND                CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                NAMES
7937133554d9 mysql:latest     "docker-entrypoint..." 15 minutes ago Up 15 minutes 3306/tcp             mysql
{{< /highlight >}}

We see that it's listening on the (default) port 3306.

## Wordpress Docker Container

Wordpress also stores content (templates, media etc.) in a folder. Again we want to persist this on the host, so we create a folder for the Wordpress content.

{{< highlight bash >}}
mkdir ~/wp-content
{{< /highlight >}}

Then launch the [Wordpress Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/). The folder created above is listed as a volume and linked to the folder `/var/www/html/wp-content` on the container. This container is also linked to the `mysql` container.

{{< highlight bash >}}
docker run --name wordpress \
  --link mysql:mysql \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v ~/wp-content:/var/www/html/wp-content \
  -d wordpress:latest
{{< /highlight >}}

Again we check that the container is up and running.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID IMAGE            COMMAND                CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                NAMES
707fcaad12e4 wordpress:latest "docker-entrypoint..." 20 minutes ago Up 20 minutes 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp wordpress
7937133554d9 mysql:latest     "docker-entrypoint..." 25 minutes ago Up 25 minutes 3306/tcp             mysql
{{< /highlight >}}

Looks good. At this point we can do a local test on the host. Since the site is not yet visible from the outside world we'll use `lynx` to open it.

{{< highlight bash >}}
lynx http://localhost/
{{< /highlight >}}

If you get something that looks like a (text mode) web page then you are in business.

## Configuring NGINX

Finally we need to expose the site to the outside world. I don't pretend to be particularly competent with [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/), but the configuration below worked for me, exposing the site on port 80.

{{< highlight text >}}
upstream wordpress {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080 fail_timeout=0;
}

server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        location / {
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                proxy_redirect off;
                #
                # How long to wait [s] before giving a 504 error.
                #
                proxy_read_timeout 900;
                proxy_pass http://wordpress;
        }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Restart NGINX and the site will be live.

### Separate Sub-Domain

I was so enthused by the ease of the above process (thank you, Docker!) that I decided to install a blog on another web site. In this case the main site is served on HTTPS. I didn't have the time to sort out SSL for the blog, so instead I put it on a separate sub-domain. All that was required was an extra entry in the NGINX `server` block.

{{< highlight text >}}
        server_name blog.example.com;
{{< /highlight >}}

## Conclusion

I'm once again astonished and thrilled by the ease with which things can be accomplished with Docker. Without it this install would probably have taken a couple of hours. However, I managed to research and implement all of this in less than an hour. And that's a reflection on the tool, not on me!
