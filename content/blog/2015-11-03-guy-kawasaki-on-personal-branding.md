title: Guy Kawasaki on Personal Branding
---

Kelsey Jones of [Search Engine Journal](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/) interviews Guy Kawasaki of [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). The key take-home message is that maintaining a personal brand is vital even if you are permanently employed. Specifically, it's important to keep a visible record of who you have worked for and your personal successes.

<blockquote>
I'm living proof. I did one thing right for Apple thirty years ago. I've been coasting ever since. Just need to do one thing really right.
<cite>Guy Kawasaki</cite>
</blockquote>

The quote above is, of course, tongue in cheek, but it bears a nugget of truth: showcase your achievements on LinkedIn and other social media because they all contribute to your personal brand.
