I was recently invited to moderate an online panel discussion entitled "The Future of ICOs". It's the first time that I have been in this role, so I did some research to find out what was expected of me. These are notes from my research mixed in with my personal observations.

CHECK SPELLING

## Preparation

There are a number of things that you need to do before the event to make sure that you are prepared.

- Prepare the welcome and introductions. The welcome will set the context for the discussion. The introductions can be very brief. Each of the speakers will probably re-introducec themselves if they give an opening remark and their biographies were probably published with the panel discussion announcement.
- Research the topic. If you are not already familiar with the topic, then now is the time to brush up. You need to know enough about the topic (key terms and acronyms, current issues) to converse with the experts on the panel.
- Research the panellists. You don't need to use the introduction provided by each panellists, you can write your own.
- Get contact details from each of panellists (LinkedIn profile, Twitter handle, GitHub username) so that you can post this on the group chat during the discussion.
- Compile a list of good questions. A good approach is to start with a relatively broad question and then become more focused on particular issues. In principle you should only need a few of these to get things started. Other questions should arise organically.
- Ping each of the panellists individually to find out if they have any suggestions for questions. Also find out if there's something in particular that they'd like to talk about. Perhaps also ask if there are any topics that they'd prefer *not* to talk about!
- Once you've compiled a list of topics and questions, circulate them to the panel so that they have a rough idea of what the programme will look like.
- Get familiar with the technical setup. Remember that you are effectively driving the show, so you'll need to know what buttons to press and when.

## Running the Show

- Your role as the voice of the audience. You need to ensure that the audience's needs are met:
	- the conversation is topical and timely;
	- their questions are answered; and
	- they are entertained and informed.
- Your role as facilitator. You need to direct the conversation. So if a panelist is dominating the conversation or heading down a narrow rabbit hole, politely steer the conversation back on track. You can do this tactfully by saying something like "Let's see what Jane thinks about this topic".
- Your role as time keeper. Ensure that the discussion starts and ends at the advertised time (although if the discussion is particularly animated, you might let it run a little over time). Ensure that each item on the programme gets its due slice of the time.
- To draw the event to a close you can say something like "Our time is almost up. Here's a quick summary of what we've talked about...".
- Share the panellists contact details.
- Depending on the platform that you are using it might be necessary to ask people to mute their microphones.
