I have just been trying to import some data into R. The data were exported from a SQL Server client in tab-separated value (TSV) format. However, reading the data into R the "usual" way produced unexpected results:

{% highlight r %}
> data <- read.delim("sample-query.tsv", header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
> head(data)
                                   V1    V2

Those weird characters in the first record... where did they come from? They don't show up in a text editor, so they're not easy to edit out.

Googling ensued and revealed that those weird characters were in fact the [byte order mark (BOM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark), special characters which indicate the endianness of the file. This was quickly confirmed using [CYGWIN](https://www.cygwin.com/). (Yes, shamefully, I am working under Windows at the moment!)

The solution is remarkably simple: just specify the correct character encoding.

{% highlight r %}
> data <- read.delim("sample-query.tsv", header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
> head(data)
                                V1    V2

{% endhighlight %}

Problem solved.
