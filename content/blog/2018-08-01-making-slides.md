Reference Duarte's book slide:ology.

## Slide Deluge

Use *lots* of slides, with just a short phrase on each slide. No images or tables. Just text, perhaps with colour for emphasis.

## Font Choice

Although it's nice to choose novel fonts, there's a problem with this. They will detract attention away from the message. So rather stick with an "ordinary" font.

Also don't choose a thin font, because this will make your text harder to read, especially from the back of the room.

## Transitions

Rather don't.
