title: 'Arthur Benjamin: Teach statistics before calculus!'

[Arthur Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_T._Benjamin) thinks that the end goal of teaching Mathematics at school should be Statistics rather than Calculus. He has a point: in terms of understanding things in the real world, Statistics is definitely more powerful. These ideas are quite compatible with those of Conrad Wolfram, who thinks that we should be [using computers more extensively](http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/2016/07/teaching-kids-real-math-computers/) in Mathematics education.

<blockquote>
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject. And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus. And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid... that the correct summit, that all of our students, every high school graduate should know, should be statistics: probability and statistics. <cite>Arthur Benjamin</cite>
