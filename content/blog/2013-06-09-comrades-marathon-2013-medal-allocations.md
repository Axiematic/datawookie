title: Medal Allocations at the Comrades Marathon
---

<!--more-->

Following up on my [previous post](http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/2013/06/comrades-marathon-2013-attrition-rate/) regarding attrition rates at Comrades Marathon 2013, here are the [statistics](http://www.exegetic.biz/) I have gathered for medal allocations. For reference, the medals are allocated as follows:

  * Gold medals to the first ten finishers in the men's race and the ladies' race;
  * Wally Hayward medals to finishers in under 06:00;
  * Silver medals to finishers under 07:30;
  * Bill Rowan medals to finishers under 09:00;
  * Bronze medals to finishers under 11:00; and finally
  * Vic Clapham medals to finishers before the final gun at 12:00.

This will be followed in a couple of days by an analysis of the relationship between running a negative split and finishing time.
