I am working on a project related to secondary effects of earthquakes. To guide me in the analysis I need a chart showing the location, magnitude and depth of recent earthquakes. There are a host of such charts available already, but since I had the required data on hand, it seemed like a good idea to take a stab at it myself.

## Getting the Data

The data was sourced from the [US Geological Survey](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/) web site. I selected dates for the decade between between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2013, magnitudes greater than 5 and chose CSV as the output format.

Loading the data into R is then simple. Some small transformations are required in order to interpret the time field in the data. I discarded a few columns which were not going to be useful, and added fields for the year and date of observation (for convenience alone: these data were already in the time field).

{% highlight r %}
> catalog <- read.csv(file.path("data", "earthquake-catalog.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
> #
> catalog <- within(catalog, {
+   time <- sub("T", " ", time)
+   time <- sub("Z", "", time)
+   time <- strptime(time, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
+   date <- as.Date(time)
+   year <- as.integer(strftime(time, format = "%Y"))
+ })
>
> catalog <- catalog[, c(12, 16, 17, 1, 2:5, 14)]
{% endhighlight %}

This is what the resulting data frame looks like:

{% highlight r %}
> head(catalog)
          id year       date                time latitude longitude depth mag                           place

{% endhighlight %}

## Making the Charts

Time to generate those charts. There are lots of ways to make maps in R, I chose to use a generic option: ggplot2.

{% highlight r %}
> require(ggplot2)
> require(maps)
> require(grid)
> 
> world.map <- map_data("world")
> 
> ggplot() +
+   geom_polygon(data = world.map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
+                fill = "#EEEECC") +
+   geom_point(data = catalog, alpha = 0.25,
+              aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, size = mag, colour = depth)) +
+   labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
+   scale_colour_gradient("Depth [m]", high = "red") +
+   scale_size("Magnitude") +
+   coord_fixed(ylim = c(-82.5, 87.5), xlim = c(-185, 185)) +
+   theme_classic() +
+   theme(axis.line = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(),
+         axis.ticks = element_blank(),
+         plot.margin=unit(c(3, 0, 0, 0),"mm"),
+         legend.text = element_text(size = 6),
+         legend.title = element_text(size = 8, face = "plain"),
+         panel.background = element_rect(fill='#D6E7EF'))
{% endhighlight %}

The resulting plot gives the location of the earthquakes as points, with magnitudes indicated by the sizes of the points and depths given by their colour.

The Earth's tectonic plates are well defined by the numerous interplate earthquakes, and there is a liberal sprinkling of intreplate events as well.

I made another chart showing the distribution of earthquakes broken down by year.

## Distribution of Earthquake Magnitudes

While we are taking a high level look at the data, it's interesting to see how the magnitudes are distributed. A logartihmic scale is necessary to make the frequencies visible over the full range of magnitudes.

{% highlight r %}
ggplot(catalog, aes(x = mag)) +
  xlab("Magnitude") + ylab("Number of Earthquakes") +
  stat_bin(drop = TRUE, binwidth = 0.25) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000)) +
  theme_classic()
{% endhighlight %}

Very nice: consistent with a power law, as described by the [Gutenberg–Richter law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law).
