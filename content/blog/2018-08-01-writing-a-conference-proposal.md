A "Call for Proposals" or "Call for Papers" (or just "CfP") is an announcement by a conference that they are accepting talk proposals.

Conference organisers are busy people. So a clear, succinct proposal is definitely going to be better received than a lengthy, rambling one.

Choose your words carefully.

Write an initial draft.

Leave it overnight. Take another look in the morning and edit.

Go for a run and mull it over. Edit accordingly.

When you have something which you think is ready for review, send it to a friend or mentor. Choose somebody who is going to give you an objective assessment. You don't want them to sugar coat it. If there are weak points then you need to know about them. That's the point of soliciting criticism.

At the same time, don't choose somebody who is going to eviscerate you. Nobody needs that kind of negativity.

## Workflow

1. Check for calls regularly.
2. Find conferences that are interesting and appropriate.
3. Diarise the deadline and make sure that you don't miss it.

## Heed the Call

Read the call. Heed the call! Things you should pay attention to:

- length of talk slots;
- suggestions for topics;
- deadline;
- support for speakers; and
- typical audience members.

Paraphrase the key points and keep this in front of you.

## History

Take a look at the talks accepted for previous iterations of the conference. These can act as an inspiration, but they can also be a basis for a new talk: expand on a topic or find a related topic.

## Setting the Tone

<blockquote>
	In terms of code, we've learned that people don't all benefit from an entire talk consisting of only code demos. Some of us love it, but some think it's boring or hard to follow. Mixing it up with tips, architecture patterns, output examples, and links to futher programming resources makes a good, balanced technical proposal.

## Components of a Proposal

### Title

Work back from the content to the title.

Go for something that's short and punchy. It can incorporate humour. But make sure that it's not *too* cute.

Here are some examples:

- "Suicidal wasps, zombie roaches and other parasite tales" (Ed Yong)
- "10 tips on how to build better binaries; you won't believe #8!" (Elliot Saba, JuliaCon 2018)
- 
- 
- "The history of our world in 18 minutes" (David Christian)
- 
- 
- 
- "I got 99 problems... palsy is just one" (Maysoon Zayid)

Thanks to Asia Lindsay for bringing some of those to my attention.

### Abstract

This is probably the most important part of the proposal. If the selection committee has to sift through hundreds of proposals then they will probably just look at the abstracts during the first cut.

A short description of the talk. Aim for just a few sentences. This should really be the [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) for your talk.

- Pose a problem.
- Briefly outline the solution.

### Description

A more detailed outline of what you'll be talking about. This is generally not published but is simply there to provide the selection committee with more information on what you will be talking about.

Things to include:

- Why your proposed talk is relevant and interesting.
- What the audience will get out of your talk. A list of outcomes works well.
- Who is the intended audience?

Convey your enthusiasm about the topic.

## Extra Information

If there's an opportunity to provide extra information, here are some things to consider:

- links to recordings of some of your previous talks;
- link to your blog;
- link to your social media accounts (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn); and
- any special equipment requirements.

## Biographic Information

## Proofreading and Feedback

Give your proposal and rest then come back to it after a day or two. Check for spelling and grammer mistakes. Is there anything that could be written more concisely? Trim the fat!

Now is also a good time to get some feedback. Preferably from somebody who knows something about the topic.

## Networking FTW

If possible, try and see if you can get access to somebody on the conference or selection committee using your network. I am not suggesting that you do anything unethical, but if you can introduce yourself, mention that you are submitting an abstract and perhaps ask some pertinent questions, then at least somebody on the inside will know who you are.

## Constraints

Always conform to the proposal constraints. If the conference is asking for an abstract of no more than 500 words, then don't be tempted to cross that threshold.

There are some constraints which are often not explicit but are just common sense:

- Choose a short, snappy title (four to ten words is good).

Here are a couple of useful tools to make the process easier and more efficient:
