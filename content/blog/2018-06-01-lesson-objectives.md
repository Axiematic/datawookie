## Bloom's Taxonomy

[Bloom's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy) consists of three hierarchies for classifying learning objectives. We are mostly concerned with the Knowledge (Cognitive) Domain hierarchy:

1. **Remembering:** retaining information but not requiring understanding; ability to recall.
2. **Comprehending:** understanding information.
3. **Applying:** applying information to unseen problems.
4. **Analyzing:** decomposing information; deductive and inductive reasoning.
5. **Evaluating:** judging quality and validity of information.
6. **Synthesizing:** combining information in a novel way.

There are typical verbs used to describe each of these objectives:

1. **Remembering:** list, recall, recognise, reproduce.
2. **Comprehending:** exemplify, explain, illustrate, paraphrase, summarise.
3. **Applying:** build, construct, interpret, predict.
4. **Analyzing:** choose, manipulate, modify, separate.
5. **Evaluating:** appraise, compare, contrast, judge, rate.
6. **Synthesizing:** arrange, assemble, combine, compose, construct, rearrange.

The two other hierarchies are the Emotion (Affective) Domain and the Action (Psychomotor) Domain.

 There are two scales reflecting complexity and specificity.
