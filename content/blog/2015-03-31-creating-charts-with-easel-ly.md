I finally got around to trying [easel.ly](http://www.easel.ly/) for creating charts. Initial impression: it's fun and easy to use. Without a Pro account your options are a little limited, but that should not stop you from creating interesting and useful charts.

Forgive me if this is a little juvenile, but I just wasn't in the zone.
