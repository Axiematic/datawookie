### Broadening the Disucussion

> Is there anything else we should consider?

> Are there other ways to approach this?

### Topic Transitions

> We seems to have touched on all of the important points, let's talk about something else.

> I think that's enough about *topic*, let's move on to *another topic*.

###  Summarising
So, can I just summarize what’s been discussed so far?
I´d now like to sum up the main points of our discussion.

### Closing

> I would like to thank our panellists speakers for their stimulating contributions. Thank you also to the audience for attending and taking part in the discussion.
