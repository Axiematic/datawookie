I needed to brush up on my JavaScript to make sense of some of the stuff that was happening in Truffle. These are my notes.

## Promises

A [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) is an alternative to providing a callback function for dealing with asynchronous results. It represents the *eventual* result of an asynchronous operation and can be in one of three states:

- **pending**
- **fulfilled** (operation completed successfully) or
- **rejected** (operation failed).

Promises are useful for working with smart contracts because interactions with the blockchain can take time (while a block is being mined). So being able to run these interactions asynchronously will ensure that your code doesn't block while waiting for results.

### Using await

This only appears to be available by default with newer versions of `node`.
