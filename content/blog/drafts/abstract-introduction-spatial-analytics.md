		Introduction to Spatial Analytics with R
	</div>
	<div class="abstract">
Spatial Analytics is a broad subject and might seem somewhat inaccessible. In this talk I'll introduce three topics which will help you get started.

- Importing spatial data (from GIS and other sources).
- Working with spatial features (points, lines and polygons).
- Visualisation.

With an understanding of these fundamentals you'll be ready to branch out into a wide range of spatial analyses.

The talk will touch on the following R packages: [maptools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html), [rgdal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html), [rgeos](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgeos/index.html), [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html), and [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html).
