	<div class="abstract">
Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) is a high-performance routing engine for calculating the shortest paths through a road network. The `osrm` package for R exposes these routing data to a wide range of potential applications.

In this talk I'll show how to eaily spin up and provision an OSRM server on AWS and use it to solve some simple spatial optimisation problems in R.

R packages: [osrm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osrm/index.html), [gaoptim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gaoptim/index.html).
