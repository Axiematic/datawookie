	Getting Started with AWS
	</div>
	<div class="abstract">
	<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer a bewildering array of Cloud options. I'll be looking at them from the perspective of a Data Scientist. In this domain there are a number of key features of AWS which can result in significant leaps in productivity. This is how you can get started.</p>

	<p>I'll be focusing on three specific topics: compute, storage and database. Specifically I'll talk about the following:</p>

	<ul>
	<li> An overview of AWS</li>
	<li> Using S3 for scalable storage</li>
	<li> Setting up a RDS database</li>
	<li> Creating an EC2 instance</li>
	<li> Connecting to the instance using SSH</li>
	<li> Adding volumes, provisioning and customising the instance</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With this knowledge in place you'll be empowered to shift a lot of your work from your local machine onto the Cloud.</p>
