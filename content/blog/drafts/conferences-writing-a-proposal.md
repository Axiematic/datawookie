Conference organisers are busy people. So a clear, succinct proposal is definitely going to be better received than a lengthy, rambling one.

Choose your words carefully.

Write an initial draft.

Leave it overnight. Take another look in the morning and edit.

Go for a run and mull it over. Edit accordingly.

When you have something which you think is ready for review, send it to a friend or mentor. Choose somebody who is going to give you an objective assessment. You don't want them to sugar coat it. If there are weak points then you need to know about them. That's the point of soliciting criticism.

At the same time, don't choose somebody who is going to eviscerate you. Nobody needs that kind of negativity.

## Setting the Tone

<blockquote>
	In terms of code, we've learned that people don't all benefit from an entire talk consisting of only code demos. Some of us love it, but some think it's boring or hard to follow. Mixing it up with tips, architecture patterns, output examples, and links to futher programming resources makes a good, balanced technical proposal.

## Components of a Proposal

### Title

### Abstract

A short description of the talk. Aim for just a few sentences. This should really be the [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) for your talk.

### Description

A more detailed outline of what you'll be talking about.

Things to include:

- Why your proposed talk is relevant and interesting.
- What the audience will get out of your talk.

Convey your enthusiasm about the topic.

## Constraints

Always conform to the proposal constraints. If the conference is asking for an abstract of no more than 500 words, then don't be tempted to cross that threshold.

There are some constraints which are often not explicit but are just common sense:

- Choose a short, snappy title (four to ten words is good).
