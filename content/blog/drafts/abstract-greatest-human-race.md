In terms of code, we've learned that people don't all benefit from an entire talk consisting of only code demos. Some of us love it, but some think it's boring or hard to follow. Mixing it up with tips, architecture patterns, output examples, and links to futher programming resources makes a good, balanced technical proposal.

	Grokking the Greatest Human Race

	<div class="abstract">
	Every year thousands of runners take part in the Comrades Marathon, the world's largest and oldest ultramarathon. This epic 90 km trip between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, is aptly known as The Ultimate Human Race. On race day, as the sweaty, happy horde of runners make their way _______________, 

	I will talk about general principles for visualising sports data as well as digging into the specifics of analysing marathon and ultramarathon results. 

	The talk will be divided into sections corresponding to the Big Five hills in the race:

	**Cowies**

	**Fields**
	
	**Bothas**

	**Inchanga**

	**Polly Shortts**
