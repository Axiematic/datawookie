The time line is not exclusively Data Science but has other salient details thrown in for good measure.

## 1950

Alan Turing develops the [Turing Test][1], which evaluates a machine&#8217;s capacity to mimic intelligent behaviour by assessing whether or not it is possible to distinguish between it and a human interlocutor.

## 1957

[Frank Rosenblatt][2] developed the Perceptron.

## 1959

[Arthur Samuel][3] developed software which allowed a computer to play checkers.

## 1967

Cover and Hart publish [Nearest neighbor pattern classification][4] describing the [k-nearest neighbors algorithm][5]. One of the first applications of this algorithm was the [Travelling Salesman Problem][6].

## 1997

On 11 May 1997 Deep Blue [narrowly defeated][7] chess champion Garry Kasparov.

## 2006

[Geoffrey Hinton][8] first uses the term &#8220;deep learning&#8221;.

## 2011

IBMâ€™s [Watson][9] beats human competitors at Jeopardy.

[Google Brain][10] project initiated.

## 2012

## 2014

Facebook develops [DeepFace][11], a facial recognition system reported to have an accuracy of 97%.

## 2015

Microsoft launched Azure Machine Learning.

[Amazon Machine Learning][12] launched.

Microsoft releases [Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit][13] on GitHub.

## 2016

Google&#8217;s AlphaGo [beats European Go champion][14], five times out of five under tournament conditions.
