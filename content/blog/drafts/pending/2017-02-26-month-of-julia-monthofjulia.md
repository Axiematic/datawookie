In a nutshell, my impression of Julia is a platform for applying Functional Programming principles to statistical and scientific problems.

I&#8217;ll apologise in advance that I have been sloppy in places and sometimes used the incorrect nomenclature. For instances, talking about &#8220;methods&#8221; when I should have said &#8220;functions&#8221;, or &#8220;class&#8221; when I should have said &#8220;type&#8221;. I trust that the intent will still be clear.

In the process of putting together these notes, I used the following invaluable references:

  * [Getting Started with Julia][1] (Ivo Balbaert, Packt Publishing); 
      * [The Julia Manual][2]. </ul>

            </td>
          </tr>
