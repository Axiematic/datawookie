> https://www.freecodecamp.com/: It&#8217;s free, super easy and the lessons are fun. In a couple of hours you can learn a bunch of new things. There&#8217;s a map that takes you on a nice linear progression from the easy stuff through to the progressively more challenging.
  
> https://www.khanacademy.org/: So very many cool things to learn. Again, free and fun.
  
> https://www.codecademy.com/: Something similar to the first item in this list. Lots of independent courses (not a linear progression though). Have a look at this which will take you from zero to building a whole web site in four hours&#8230; now that&#8217;s pretty cool!
