Chairing a session at a conference is a challenging and important responsibility. It involves much more than simply introducing speakers and handling questions from the audience. Being an effective chairperson requires forethought and preparation.

The chairperson must ensure that all aspects of the session run smoothly.

## Advantages of being a Session Chair

- You're not just a spectator.
- You will probably qualify for a reduced ticket price.

## Before the Conference

If possible, contact the speakers in your session to introduce yourself.

Establishing a dialogue in advance of the conference also helps to ensure that the speakers will arrive (or at least give you advanced warning of anybody who might fail to show up!).

## Starting the Session

Always start the session on time! It doesn't matter if people are still drifting into the room. If the session is scheduled to start at 08:30 then it should start promptly: neither sooner nor later.

It may be necessary to get the audience's attention, in which case you can start with a simple "Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?"

Kick off the session by welcoming the audience. Mention how many speakers will be presenting, the expected duration of the session, any changes to the programme and when questions will be handled (after each talk or at the end of the session). This is also a good time to make any housekeeping announcements. You should remind the audience to either turn off or mute their phones.

Although you will have discussed timing with the speakers beforehand, this is a good time to reiterate and also make it clear to the audience.

> Good afternoon. Welcome to session "*session name or number*" of "*conference name*". I am *your name* and I'll be chairing this session. The session will run from now until the lunch break. There will be six talks and every speaker will have 15 minutes for their presentation, followed by 5 minutes for Q&A.

> There have been some minor changes to the programme. The presentation on *topic* by *speaker* has been moved to *time* in *location* and is being replaced with a talk but *another speaker* on *another topic*.

Give a brief outline for the session and describe the theme. This might be something like the following:

> Before the coffee break we heard about techniques for data acquisition. This session focuses on data preparation, cleaning and dealing with outliers. We'll hear about how this can be done using SQL, Python and R. The first talk will be given by...

## Introducting Speakers

A speaker's name, affilitaion and the title of his presentation are generally displayed on their first slide. So, rather than repeating this information, this is an opportunity to mention something about the speaker or topic which is not included on that slide. This information can act as a social bridge, making it easier for members of the audience to approach the speaker after the talk. Here's an example:

If the speaker's name is unfamiliar, practice saying it out loud a few times so that you are sure that you can get your tongue around it.

The same applies to talk titles: if there are unfamiliar words, either practice them or find a way to avoid them (by paraphrasing the title).

> The next speaker is Jane Vermaak. She is originally from South Africa, but currently lives in London. She has a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Cape Town and is currently head of Research and Development at the Omega Corporation.

Another approach to the introduction is to mention the speaker's name at the end. This will likely lead to applause even before the talk, which gets things off to a good start.

> The next speaker is originally from South Africa, but currently lives in London. She has a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Cape Town and is currently head of Research and Development at the Omega Corporation. Please welcome Jane Vermaak, who will be talking about Bayesian analysis of elite athlete performance.

How formal should you be in referring to the speakers? It's generally a good idea to be relatively formal (mention title and full name) since, although you might know the speaker personally, the majority of the audience might not.

The depth of the introduction will depend on the time available. If this is a keynote presentation then obviously a longer introduction is appropriate. Otherwise it is generally sufficient to mention the speaker's name and what they are talking about. If the talk has a long and complicated title, feel free to paraphrase that in the introduction.

Once you've made the introduction, you need to disappear. The attention of the audience should be completely on the speaker.

## Managing Time

Keeping control of timing is perhaps the most important task for the chairperson. You need to ensure that the session starts and ends on schedule. You also need to make sure that every speaker gets their allotted time (and that no speaker steals time from other speakers). Make no mistake: this can be challenging!

Generally a session will be precisely long enough for the scheduled talks. So, for example, a session consisting of six 20 minute talks will have a duration of two hours. There's little or no wriggle room there: if you want the session to end on time, then every talk needs to be kept to time.

This is how each of those 20 minute slots might be broken down:

- 00:00 - introduce the speaker (speaker takes the stage);
- 00:30 - speaker starts
- 10:30 - 5 minute warning
- 13:30 - 2 minute warning
- 14:30 - 1 minute warning
- 15:30 - speaker stops (initiate applause)
- 15:40 - start Q&A
- 20:00 - close Q&A (initiate applause); introduce next speaker.

The time allocated for Q&A should not be used by the speaker for their presentation. This is not the speaker's time; it's the audience's time.

This is highly idealised, but it's the kind of structure that you could aim for. The conference may have some guidelines on how they want the slots to be broken down. If so, try to adhere to those. Regardless of what structure you impose on the slots, you need to inform the speakers prior to the session so that they can prepare accordingly.

Either write down the time at which each slot actually began or use the stopwatch on your phone to keep track of time.

There are a variety of ways that you can communicate the time warnings to the speakers. I have found the most reliable to be a collection of four A4 sheets with "5 mins", "2 mins", "1 min" and "Time's up!" printed on them in large, bold characters. Hold these above your head so that the speaker cannot miss them.

Many speakers do not rehearse their talks, so they have no idea of just how much time they need to cover their content. They often underestimate the true duration of their talk!

There are a few things that you can do to help keep things on track:

- contact the speakers before the conference (by email if possible) and remind them about the duration of their slots (for example, 15 minutes for talking, 3 minutes for questions and 2 minutes for changing speakers);
- meet with the speakers before the session and remind them of the time constraints. Also agree with them on signals which will be used to indicate 5 minutes, 2 minutes and 1 minute to go (either simple hand signals or flash cards);
- make sure that you are readily visible to the speaker and that they can see the time signals;
- stand up just before the speaker's time is up.

If a speaker tries to continue speaking despite your visual cues, you will need to ask them to stop. Be respectful but firm. This is not pleasant, but it's part of your job. The audience and other speakers will appreciate it. Try something like "I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I'm afraid that you are out of time . You need to wrap up immediately so that I can introduce the next speaker."

If your session is falling behind time you need to try and get it back on schedule. It would not be reasonable to intrude into the allotted speaking time, however there are some options:

- constrain the number of questions (suggest that they rather chat in the coffee break) and
- limit the duration of introductions by simply mentioning the speaker's name and topic.

These will at least allow you to win back a few minutes per talk.

## Question Time

Unless their is very good reason to do otherwise, the chairperson should run the Q&A. Let the speaker focus on answering the questions. This also ensures that the distribution of questions is equitable.

A good approach is to select two questions at a time: "First we'll take a question from *person* and then we'll move on to a question from *another person*." This primes the second person so that they have a fully articulated question. It also establishes a sense of continuity.

Question time can often be the best part of a talk and your role as chairperson is to encourage a dialogue between the audience and the speaker. The objective with the Q&A is twofold: the speaker gets feedback on their presentation and the audience has the opportunity to receive answers to their specific questions.

At the end of each talk wait for the applause to subside (if necessary, you are responsible to kick off the applause!). If time permits then ask the audience if they have any questions for the speaker. If there are no immediate questions, give the audience a moment to think. Encourage them to ask questions. Often just a single question will be enough to trigger a deluge of additional questions. If there are too many questions to accommodate within the time limits, encourage the audience to chat to the speaker during a break.

There are two approaches to handling question time: either you can manage questions from the floor or you can leave it to the speaker. Which of these you choose may vary depending on the conference, the speaker or how well you are managing to keep on time.

It's imperative that you keep an eye on the time and bring questions to a conclusion so that the next speaker can start on time.

If a number of people want to ask questions simultaneously, acknowledge each with a nod of your head (so that they know they've been seen) and then select one to start with. Remember where the rest of the questions were coming from and return to them when the speaker has answered the first question. Try to distribute the questions equitably: everybody gets their turn before anybody receives a second chance.

What happens if there are no questions from the floor? You could just move on to the next talk. However, this is rather anticlimactic for the speaker. If possible, prepare your own question for the speaker. You can actually do this ahead of time by reading the abstract and thinking of a general question to ask. Alternatively, you can ask the speaker if there are any questions that they would like you to ask. Asking a question as the chairperson should always be a last resort and questions from the floor always take precedence. You might well find that your question will trigger other questions from the audience.

> Since nobody is ready to ask a question, I'll take the opportunity to ask...

> Let me break the ice...

A general way to ask a question goes like "Could you please expand on *some aspect of talk*". This is sufficiently vague that you are not putting the speaker on the spot, but should at least get the ball rolling.

How to deal with various situations during question time:

- time is almost up: "We have time for one last question.";
- question is unclear: ask for clarification ("Could you be more specific?") or try to paraphrase ("If I understand you correctly, then you are asking...") or if all else fails suggest that the question be answered in the break;
- somebody is dominating questions: "Thank you. We need to give other members of the audience a chance to ask questions. Perhaps chat to the speaker during a break?";
- somebody is asking a long rambling question: "Would you please come to the point?".
- somebody is making a statement rather than asking a question: "Would you please ask a question?".

Your role during Q&A has two components: ensuring that the audience has a decent opportunity to pose questions and acting on behalf of the speaker. So it's important to try and help the speaker to understand any vague questions and also cut off anybody in the audience who is belligerent or making a statement rather than asking a question.

At the end of the question time it's appropriate to thank the speaker and trigger another round of applause.

## Closing the Session

If necessary, make any annoncements.

Thank the speakers for their contributions and the audience for their attendance. Initiate another round of applause.

## Contigency Plans

### Speaker doesn't arrive

How you deal with this will depend on the conference format. If there is just a single session then it makes sense to proceed with the following talk on the programme. This will win you some time and let subsequent speakers have slight longer slots. However, if there are parallel sessions then you need to take into account that people will be moving between sessions. So the next talk still needs to start on schedule. In this case you need to inform the audience that there will be a break before the next talk starts and perhaps encourage them to temporarily move to a different session.

Some conferences will have a list of standby talks (people who submitted an abstract, didn't get a slot but still came prepared to speak). Enquire from the conference organisers if this is an option. One of these can be used to fill an empty slot in your session.

You can hold an impromptue Q&A session with the session speakers who have already presented.

### Speaker runs over time

What to do if a speaker ignores your time warnings and simply keeps on talking? As the session chair you are responsible for reining (???) them in. You can start by saying "time's up" softly. If that does not get the speaker to stop, then you can repeat yourself somewhat louder. If that still does not have the desired effect, you can resort to something along the lines of "We've reached the end of your time slot and we need to move on to the next speaker." Then, addressing the audience, "If anybody has questions for the speaker, I encourage you to ask them during the break."

## Other Considerations

### Learn from Others

When you're sitting in other sessions at a conference, take note of how the chairperson is managing the session. This is a good way to learn what does and does not work, as well as getting an idea of the role of chairperson at this particular conference.

### Live Tweeting

There are a few things that you can do to make it easier for people who are live tweeting your session.

Before the session and between talks put up a slide with the Twitter handles for the speakers and some suggested hash tags.

You can also make this information available before the session. Posting it on your feed will mean that the audience has access to it during the talks.

It might be helpful to draw up a simple document with a table containing the speakers' names, Twitter handles and talk titles. Include any other relevant handles or hashtags.

### Paying Attention

As chairperson you need to model the behaviour you expect from the audience. So it's not appropriate for you to be engrossed in your phone or laptop during a talk. Be attentive. By all means post a few pertinent tweets, but your attention should otherwise be focused on the speaker.
