Roselinde Torres makes some insightful observations about leadership. Here&#8217;s a selection of germane quotes from her talk, which is well worth watching.

> Great leaders are not head-down. They see around corners, shaping their future, not just reacting to it.<cite>Roselinde Torres</cite>

> Great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions, because you have people that are thinking differently than you are.<cite>Roselinde Torres</cite>

> And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is na√Øve or reckless or just plain stupid.<cite>Roselinde Torres</cite>
