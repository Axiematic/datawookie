Yesterday we had a look at Julia's regression model capabilities. A natural counterpart to these are models which perform classification. We'll be looking at the GLM and [DecisionTree](http://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl) packages. But, before I move on to that, I should mention the [MLBase](http://mlbasejl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) package which provides a load of functionality for data preprocessing, performance evaluation, cross-validation and model tuning.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression lies on the border between the regression techniques we considered yesterday and the classification techniques we're looking at today. In effect though it's really a classification technique. We'll use some data generated in yesterday's post to illustrate. Specifically we'll look at the relationship between the Boolean field `valid` and the three numeric fields.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> head(points)
6x4 DataFrame
| Row | x        | y       | z       | valid |
|-----|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1   | 0.867859 | 3.08688 | 6.03142 | false |
| 2   | 9.92178  | 33.4759 | 2.14742 | true  |
| 3   | 8.54372  | 32.2662 | 8.86289 | true  |
| 4   | 9.69646  | 35.5689 | 8.83644 | true  |
| 5   | 4.02686  | 12.4154 | 2.75854 | false |
| 6   | 6.89605  | 27.1884 | 6.10983 | true  |

To further refresh your memory, the plot below shows the relationship between `valid` and the variables `x` and `y`. We're going to attempt to capture this relationship in our model.

Logistic regression is also applied with the `glm()` function from the GLM package. The call looks very similar to the one used for linear regression except that the error family is now `Binomial()` and we're using a logit link function.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> model = glm(valid ~ x + y + z, points, Binomial(), LogitLink())
DataFrameRegressionModel{GeneralizedLinearModel{GlmResp{Array{Float64,1},Binomial,LogitLink},
                         DensePredChol{Float64,Cholesky{Float64}}},Float64}:
Coefficients:
              Estimate Std.Error   z value Pr(>|z|)
(Intercept)   -23.1457   3.74348  -6.18295    <1e-9
x            -0.260122  0.269059 -0.966786   0.3337
y              1.36143  0.244123    5.5768    <1e-7
z             0.723107   0.14739   4.90606    <1e-6
{{< / highlight >}}

According to the model there is a significant relationship between `valid` and both `y` and `z` but not `x`. Looking at the plot above we can see that `x` does have an influence on `valid` (there is a gradual transition from false to true with increasing `x`), but that this effect is rather "fuzzy", hence the large p-value. By comparison there is a very clear and abrupt change in `valid` at `y` values of around 15. The effect of `y` is also about twice as strong as that of `z`. All of this makes sense in light of the way that the data were constructed.

## Decision Trees

Now we'll look at another classification technique: [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). First load the required packages and then grab the [iris](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/iris.html) data.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> using MLBase, DecisionTree
julia> using RDatasets, Distributions
julia> iris = dataset("datasets", "iris");
julia> iris[1:5,:]
5&#215;5 DataFrame
| Row | SepalLength | SepalWidth | PetalLength | PetalWidth | Species |
|-----|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| 1   | 5.1         | 3.5        | 1.4         | 0.2        | "setosa" |
| 2   | 4.9         | 3.0        | 1.4         | 0.2        | "setosa" |
| 3   | 4.7         | 3.2        | 1.3         | 0.2        | "setosa" |
| 4   | 4.6         | 3.1        | 1.5         | 0.2        | "setosa" |
| 5   | 5.0         | 3.6        | 1.4         | 0.2        | "setosa" |

We'll also define a Boolean variable to split the data into training and testing sets.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> train = rand(Bernoulli(0.75), nrow(iris)) .== 1;
{{< / highlight >}}

We split the data into features and labels and then feed those into `build_tree()`. In this case we are building a classifier to identify whether or not a particular iris is of the versicolor variety.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> features = array(iris[:,1:4]);
julia> labels = [n == "versicolor" ? 1 : 0 for n in iris[:Species]];
julia> model = build_tree(labels[train], features[train,:]);
{{< / highlight >}}

Let's have a look at the product of a labours.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> print_tree(model)
Feature 3, Threshold 3.0
L-> 0 : 36/36
R-> Feature 3, Threshold 4.8
    L-> Feature 4, Threshold 1.7
        L-> 1 : 38/38
        R-> 0 : 1/1
    R-> Feature 3, Threshold 5.1
        L-> Feature 1, Threshold 6.7
            L-> Feature 2, Threshold 3.2
                L-> Feature 4, Threshold 1.8
                    L-> Feature 1, Threshold 6.3
                        L-> 0 : 1/1
                        R-> 1 : 1/1
                    R-> 0 : 5/5
                R-> 1 : 1/1
            R-> 1 : 2/2
        R-> 0 : 29/29

The textual representation of the tree above breaks the decision process down into a number of branches where the model decides whether to go to the left (L) or right (R) branch according to whether or not the value of a given feature is above or below a threshold value. So, for example, on the third line of the output we must decide whether to move to the left or right depending on whether feature 3 (PetalLength) is less or greater than 4.8.

We can then apply the decision tree model to the testing data and see how well it performs using standard metrics.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> predictions = apply_tree(model, features[!train,:]);
julia> ROC = roc(labels[!train], convert(Array{Int32,1}, predictions))
ROCNums{Int64}
  p = 8
  n = 28
  tp = 7
  tn = 28
  fp = 0
  fn = 1
julia> precision(ROC)
1.0
julia> recall(ROC)
0.875
{{< / highlight >}}

A true positive rate of 87.5% and true negative rate of 100% is not too bad at all!

You can find a more extensive introduction to using decision trees with Julia [here](http://bensadeghi.com/decision-trees-julia/). The DecisionTree package also implements [random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and boosting models. Other related packages are:

* [SVM](https://github.com/JuliaStats/SVM.jl) ([support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)); 
* [kNN](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/kNN.jl) ([k-nearest neighbours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)); 
* [GradientBoost](https://github.com/svs14/GradientBoost.jl) (gradient boosting); 
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/antinucleon/XGBoost.jl) (extreme gradient boosting); 
* [Orchestra](http://github.com/svs14/Orchestra.jl) (ensemble learning).

Definitely worth checking out if you have the time. My time is up though. Come back soon to hear about what Julia provides for evolutionary programming.
