... but be careful with your plots: they might be misinterpreted.

Amy Cuddy gives a great [talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are.html). Provided me with lots to think about and I will happily confess that I have struck a few power poses (but only after ensuring that I am quite alone)!

There is just one thing that troubles me about the talk. The plot below.

The choice of the scale on the y-axis gives the impression that risk tolerance in the Low Power group is roughly 30% of that in the High Power group. This strongly supports her hypothesis. However, careful inspection reveals that the correct ratio is actually around 70%. It might be unintentional, but in my opinion, a plot of ratio scale data should always have axes which go all the way to zero!
