I've updated my Comrades Marathon pacing chart to include both the Up and Down runs. You can grab it [here](http://162.243.184.248/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/comrades-pacing.xlsx). The data for this year's race are not yet finalised (I _think_ we will be running 87 km), but you can make changes when it's all confirmed.

The use of the chart is explained in a [previous post](http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/2014/05/personalised-comrades-marathon-pacing-chart/). Any feedback on how this can be improved would be appreciated.
