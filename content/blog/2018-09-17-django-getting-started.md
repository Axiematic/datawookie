It seems a little surreal that it's be more than a year since I completed my [#MonthOfJulia][1] project. About time for another month of learning, and the first day of a new year is as good a time as any to start. This time around I'll be looking at [Django][2]. To be honest I've been working with Django for almost a year already now, but I'm painfully aware that there's so much more to learn. So some of my daily entries will be fleshing out things that I've already learned, while others will be documenting fresh learnings.

## Online Resources

## Books

* [Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.8][3] (Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfeld): Written in a rather unorthodox style, this book is packed with highly distilled Django content. 
* [Lightweight Django: Using REST, WebSockets, and Backbone][4] (Julia Elman and Mark Lavin) 
* [High Performance Django][5] (Peter Baumgartner and Yann Malet) 
* [Django by Example Paperback][6] (Antonio Mel√©) 
* [Django Design Patterns and Best Practices][7] (Arun Ravindran) 
* [Learning Django Web Development][8] (Sanjeev Jaiswal and Ratan Kumar)

## Videos

There are a couple of great video courses in the [CodingEntrepreneurs][9] channel:

* [Try Django 1.8 --- Create an MVP Landing Page][10] 
* [Try Django 1.9 --- Build a Django Blog][11]

There are a number of other relevant videos in this channel, so well worth rummaging around.
