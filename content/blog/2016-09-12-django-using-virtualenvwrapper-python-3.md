By default the version of `virtualenvwrapper` on my machine uses Python 2. Not terribly useful since I'm focusing on using Python 3. A few small tweaks were required.

## Install

First install `virtualenvwrapper`.

{% highlight bash %}  
$ sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
{% endhighlight %}

This will install as the root user. If you don't have root privileges, just omit the `sudo`.

## Configure

Add the following content to your `.bashrc`:
  
{% highlight bash %}
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenv
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
{% endhighlight %}

These commands will do the following:

  1. tell `virtualenvwrapper` to use the Python 3 interpreter by default; 
      * select a folder in which virtual environments will be stored; and 
          * load a bunch of shell functions. </ol> 
            If you didn't install `virtualenvwrapper` as the root user then you'd source `$HOME/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` instead.
            
            These changes will only take effect when you open a new shell.
            
            **Note:** I ran into a situation where, even with the configuration above, my virtual environments were still being created with Python 2. In this case you can make an alias.

{% highlight bash %}  
alias mkvirtualenv="mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3"
{% endhighlight %}
            
## Use

### Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a new virtual environment, do the following:
  
{% highlight bash %}  
$ mkvirtualenv test
{% endhighlight %}
            
You'll find the interpreter in the resulting environment will automatically be Python 3, as required.

{% highlight bash %} 
(test) $ python
Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
{% endhighlight %}
 
Any packages installed while this environment is active will be encapsulated within the environment.

### Attaching and Detaching the Virtual Environment

To enter that environment in the future, do

{% highlight bash %} 
$ workon test
{% endhighlight %}

To exit the environment, simply do

{% highlight bash %} 
(test) $ deactivate
{% endhighlight %}

If you no longer require the environment then remove it with

{% highlight bash %} 
$ rmvirtualenv test
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion

I'd been working away fine without running into any package conflicts. Fine until... wham! Everything broke. Now I'm a believer: virtual environments are the future.

A full reference to `virtualenvwrapper` functionality can be found [here][1]. Well worth a read if you are interested in using all of the (many) bells and whistles.
