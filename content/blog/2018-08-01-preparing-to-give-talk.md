Here are somethings that are worth thinking about in the days leading up to a talk:

## Network

What is the network setup like at the conference?

- Make sure that all of the ports you need are open. For example, if you need to use SSH then make sure that port 22 is open.

## Demo

A demo is probably one of the riskier things that you can do during a talk. But there are some ways that you can mitigate the risk.

1. Record the demo, so that if things go wrong live then you can always revert to the recording.
