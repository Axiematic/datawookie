> Standing on the shoulders of giants is all well and good, but before jumping on someone’s back you might want to make sure that they can take the weight. There is a focus in the business world to use data science to sell advertisements. You may have access to the best dataset in the world, but if the people employing you only want you to find out how to best sell shoes with it, is it really worth it?
