title: Setting Up Time Zones in BASH
---

Ensuring that your account is configured to run with appropriate time zone information can make your life a lot easier.

Of course, if you administer your own system then you can simply set your system time to local time. However, it's generally a better idea to set system time to Universal Time (UTC) and then configure time zone information on a per-user basis.

Why does this make sense? Well, suppose that you have remote users logging onto your system. It's very likely that a remote user will be operating in a different time zone and it'd be handy for them to have system time converted into their local time.

There's a handy utility for putting this in place: `tzselect`. It presents a couple of simple menus and then delivers a small chunk of code that you'd include in a user's `.profile` file to ensure that their time zone is configured correctly.

Here's an example of selecting the time zone for South Africa.

{{< highlight text >}}
$ tzselect
Please identify a location so that time zone rules can be set correctly.
Please select a continent, ocean, "coord", or "TZ".
 1) Africa
 2) Americas
 3) Antarctica
 4) Asia
 5) Atlantic Ocean
 6) Australia
 7) Europe
 8) Indian Ocean
 9) Pacific Ocean
10) coord - I want to use geographical coordinates.
11) TZ - I want to specify the time zone using the Posix TZ format.

#? 43

The following information has been given:

        South Africa

Therefore TZ='Africa/Johannesburg' will be used.
Local time is now:      Mon Aug 21 05:06:15 SAST 2017.
Universal Time is now:  Mon Aug 21 03:06:15 UTC 2017.
Is the above information OK?
1) Yes
2) No
#? 1

You can make this change permanent for yourself by appending the line
        TZ='Africa/Johannesburg'; export TZ
to the file '.profile' in your home directory; then log out and log in again.

Here is that TZ value again, this time on standard output so that you
can use the /usr/bin/tzselect command in shell scripts:
Africa/Johannesburg
{{< /highlight >}}

To configure my account with this time zone information, I'd simply add

{{< highlight bash >}}
TZ='Africa/Johannesburg'; export TZ
{{< /highlight >}}

to my `.profile` file. It would come into effect the next time I logged into the system.
