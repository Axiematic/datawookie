A short note on how to set up Jupyter Notebooks with Python 3 on Ubuntu. The instructions are specific to Xenial Xerus (16.04) but are likely to be helpful elsewhere too.

## Python Prerequisites

Make sure that you have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ sudo apt install python3
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
{{< / highlight >}}

Also install the IPython shell.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ sudo apt install ipython3
{{< / highlight >}}

## Install Jupyter

It's then a simple matter to install Jupyter.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ pip3 install jupyter
{{< / highlight >}}

That installed the executables into `~/.local/bin/`, which then needs to be added to the execution path.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/
{{< / highlight >}}

It's a good idea to add that to one of your startup scripts, probably `.bashrc`.

## Execution Time

At this stage you should be ready to roll.

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ jupyter notebook
{{< / highlight >}}

That will open up a new Jupyter browser tab. From there you'll be able to browse to find existing notebooks or create a new notebook by pressing the `New` dropdown and selecting the notebook type.
