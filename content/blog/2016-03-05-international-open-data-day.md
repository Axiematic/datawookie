As part of [International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) we spent the morning with a bunch of like minded people poring over some open Census South Africa data. Excellent initiative, [@opendatadurban](https://twitter.com/opendatadurban), I'm very excited to see where this is all going and look forward to contributing to the journey!

The data above show the distribution of ages in a segment of the South African population who have either no schooling (blue) or have completed Grade 12 (orange). Click the image to access the [interactive plot](https://plot.ly/~collierab/457/count-vs-age/). Being a subset of the complete data set, this does not tell the full story, but it's still a rather interesting view on the state of education in South Africa.
