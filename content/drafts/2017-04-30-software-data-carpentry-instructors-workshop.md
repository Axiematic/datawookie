USE THE ETHERPAD

A Software / Data Carpentry Instructors' Workshop was held in Cape Town from 30 April to 2 May 2017.

### Stickies as Status Indicators

Pink - I need help.
Green - All good. Finished task.

Non-threatening way for learners to give feedback (better than holding hand in air).

## Learning Theory

Levels of competence:

- Novice;
- Competent Practitioner; and
- Expert.

Mental Models

Learning materials:

- Tutorial: Step-by-step guide, more suited to beginners.
- Manual: Information dense. Inaccessible to beginners since hard to get a "big picture" view.

Learners often have misconceptions.

### Assessment

#### Types of Assessment

_Formative Assessment_ = assessment conducted during learning process to modify teaching and learning activities.

- Slow down? Speed up? Deeper? Too deep?
- Should be done frequently (roughly every 10 minutes or so).
- Use "peer instruction" to resolve issues.

_Summative Assessment_ = evaluate learning at end of instructional unit by comparing against benchmark.

#### Forms of Assessment

- Multiple Choice Questions

  * Ensure that "other" options are feasible and that answer not too easy. These are "distractors". These will be based on common misconceptions.
  * Have "pick the false item" questions.
  * Start with the end in mind. What do you want to assess with this question? Not just getting the right answer. If a lot of learners are getting the same wrong answer, that is also interesting.

### Teaching as a Performing Art

### Expertise and Memory

#### Concept Maps

#### Chunking

- When introducing new concepts, try to link them to older ones.

### Live Coding

### Cognitive Load

Main learning goal versus all of the other stuff that needs to be included in order to accomplish that goal. Syntax. Platform. Software install issues.

Extraneous load distracts the mind from the germane load (the core principal that is being taught).

### Teaching Practices

- Stickies
- Live Coding (no slides!)
- Jargon Busting

#### Surveys

- Pre-course survey
- Post-course survey

#### Advertising

When advertising a course be clear about what "carpentry" is and what topics will be covered. This ensures that you get the appropriate audience.

#### Helpers

Never run a workshop without helpers. They deal with all the "pink sticky" issues.

If there are people in the audience who are clearly already experience and familiar with the material then turn them into helpers. Or ask them to pair up with somebody who is struggling.

#### Feedback

Ask for feedback before lunch and at the end of the day. Go through feedback immediately and respond as quickly as possible.

#### Software Setup

Consider having an "Installation Clinic" prior to the workshop during which everybody installs all of the required software.

### Motivation and Demotivation

Apply the Pareto Principle: teach the items with maximum impact and which take the minimum amount of time first!
