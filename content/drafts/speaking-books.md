## HOW TO GIVE A TED TALK

## Propose, Prepare, Present

*Propose, Prepare, Present* by [Alistair CrollVerified account](https://twitter.com/acroll)

Croll mentions the concept of <em>information arbitrage</em> (see the figure above from his book): you need to strike the balance between the breadth of appeal and the value of the content. We'll forgive him for the spelling error.

- **Chapter 1:** Creating a New Slide Ideology
- **Chapter 2:** Creating Ideas, Not Slides
- **Chapter 3:** Creating Diagrams
- **Chapter 4:** Displaying Data
- **Chapter 5:** Thinking Like a Designer
- **Chapter 6:** Arranging Elements
- **Chapter 7:** Using Visual Elements: Background, Color, and Text
- **Chapter 8:** Using Visual Elements: Images
- **Chapter 9:** Creating Movement
- **Chapter 10:** Governing with Templates
- **Chapter 11:** Interacting with Slides
- **Chapter 12:** Manifesto: The Five Theses of the Power of a Presentation

Duarte gives a useful time line for preparing a talk (30 slides, duration 1 hour):

- *6-20 hours*: conducting research;
- *1 hour*: mapping out the prospective audience's needs;
- *2 hours*: generate ideas and arrange on sticky notes;
- *1 hour*: organise ideas;
- *1 hour*: get feedback on ideas;
- *2 hours*: sketch the talk structure;
- *20-60 hours*: build slides; and
- *3 hours*: rehearsal!

This makes for a total of between 36 and 90 hours. A major commitment! And time that you should only commit if you foresee a reasonable return on investment.

How much content goes on a single slide?

<blockquote>
	Ask yourself whether your message can be processed effectively within three seconds.
	<cite>Nancy Duarte, *slide:ology*</cite>
</blockquote>

What's the value of breathing room?

<blockquote>
	Ask yourself, “What can I take away that won’t change the meaning?” or “Where can I split the content into more than one slide?” Keep in mind that a slide’s value is determined not by the amount of information it contains, but by how clearly it communicates its message.

## Confessions of a Public Speaker

*Confessions of a Public Speaker* by [Scott Berkun](https://twitter.com/berkun)

A really entertaining read with lots of actionable suggestions. The author walks the walk: Berkun says that story telling is an integral part of entertainment and this book is packed with stories.

- **Chapter 1:** I can’t see you naked
- **Chapter 2:** The attack of the butterflies
- **Chapter 3:** $30,000 an hour
- **Chapter 4:** How to work a tough room
- **Chapter 5:** Do not eat the microphone
- **Chapter 6:** The science of not boring people
- **Chapter 7:** Lessons from my 15 minutes of fame
- **Chapter 8:** The things people say
- **Chapter 9:** The clutch is your friend
- **Chapter 10:** Confessions

- Photos you don’t expect to see
- Backstage notes
- The little things pros do
- How to make a point
- What to do if your talk sucks
- What to do when things go wrong
- You can’t do worse than this
- Research and recommendations

	Remove all nipple piercings well before your lecture begins.

Not something that would have occurred to me, but the advice seems legit.
