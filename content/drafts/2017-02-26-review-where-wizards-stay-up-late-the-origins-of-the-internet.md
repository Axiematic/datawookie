I&#8217;ve just finished reading [Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet][1] by Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon (Simon & Schuster, 1996). This is not a new book and it&#8217;s been on my reading list for a while

> Vulnerability notwithstanding, the idea of slicing data into message blocks and sending each block out to find its own way through a matrix of phone lines struck AT&T staff members as totally preposterous. Their world was a place where communications were sent as a stream of signals down a pipe. Sending data in small parcels seemed just about as logical as sending oil down a pipeline one cupful at a time.

> “It’s one thing when you plug into a socket in the wall and electrons flow,” said Bob Kahn. “It’s another thing when you have to figure out, for every electron, which direction it takes.”

DON&#8217;T INCLUDE THIS: JUST USE FOR BACKGROUND INFORMATION.

> You could certainly build a network experiment in a single laboratory—if you wanted to. By this time Donald Davies had finally been given the go-ahead and some funding to do just that at the National Physical Laboratory in London, using short lines, each hundreds of yards at most. Kahn was sure that a small-network experiment wouldn’t “scale up,” at least not in practical terms. He reasoned that short links in a laboratory wouldn’t have the same real-world error rates and problems as the long lines used in the telephone system. The real goal was to link computer scientists, and eventually other computer users, cross- country. So a real network would have to cover thousands of miles, and would have to be designed to handle packets—and correct phone-line errors—at a much higher rate than any small network.

> “There was an infinity of ways we could go wrong, and a substantial number of ways to go right,” said Walden, the first programmer Heart had signed on. “Good engineers find one of the ways of going right.”
