Don&#8217;t make average products for average people. Aim for the outliers. Rather target the Early Adopters, Innovators and the Laggards. Especially target the [otaku][1]. These are the people who care. Average people have become very good at ignoring your message.

Make sure that people are talking about your product. Advertising doesn&#8217;t necessarily help. Having a remarkable product does.

> The thing that&#8217;s going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is: &#8220;Is it remarkable?&#8221; And &#8220;remarkable&#8221; is a really cool word, because we think it just means &#8220;neat,&#8221; but it also means &#8220;worth making a remark about.&#8221; And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going.<cite>Seth Godin</cite>

> The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe. &#8230; The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable. And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do. Very good is boring. Very good is average. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you&#8217;re making a record album, or you&#8217;re an architect, or you have a tract on sociology. If it&#8217;s very good, it&#8217;s not going to work, because no one&#8217;s going to notice it.<cite>Seth Godin</cite>
