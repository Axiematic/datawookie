A Decentralised Application (or "DApp"; or, if you're one of the cool kids, "√êApp") is a ...

Each client connects to its own instance of the Dapp. No central server involved. This is diametrically opposite to the "conventional" web application where all clients communicate with one (or a few) central servers.

A disadvantage of Dapps is that everybody needs to have a local copy of the whole blockchain. This is a necessary evil though: to get around the problem of all data being stored on one central server, you need to create many copies of the data so that it's distributed across numerous locations.

## web3

[web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) is a JavaScript library which facilitates interactions with Ethereum nodes and smart contracts.

### Installing web3.js

Install the web3.js module by running the following inside your project folder:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -S web3
{% endhighlight %}

That will install the latest version of web3.js. However it's probably better to install a specific (stable) version.

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -S web3@0.20.1
{% endhighlight %}

## Installing web3.py

A decentralised application will most likely provide the capability to either

- deploy a contract and then
- interact with that contract

or

- interact with an existing contract.
