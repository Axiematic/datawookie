There should be no (or as few as possible) unknowns associated with giving a talk. One way that you can reduce the uncertainties is to rehearse your content.

The majority of conference speakers don't rehearse their talks. You can really raise your game by being one of the few who does!

These are the merits of practiciting:

- it allows you to figure out what you should take out of your talk (leaving stuff out can often substantially improve your talk);
- it allows you to figure out what you still need to include in your talk (sometimes you need to add something in to bridge the gap between one point and the next);

There are innumerable things that can go wrong when you are giving a talk. Many of those are beyond your control. However, by rehearsing you are taking control of and mitigating those things over which you have control.

## Demos

Capture your demo on video. So if things go horrendously wrong on the day you'll have a backup plan.
