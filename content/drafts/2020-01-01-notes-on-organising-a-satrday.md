* Don't get embroiled in negotiations with invited speakers regarding flights. You can waste a lot of time and end up frustrating both parties. Simply find out when they want to arrive and depart, then book them flights which are as economical and comfortable as possible. Of course, get a firm commitment from them before you go booking anything! 
* Close ticket sales a decent time before the conference. It might seem that you can keep selling tickets all the way up to the event, but if you are planning on giving out things like t-shirts and goodie bags then you'll need to know the exact numbers and have time to source these things!

## Venue

Things to check:

* wifi connection with sufficient bandwidth 
* projector, screen, microphone, stage, lectern
* Clicker

## Sponsors

Ideas for sponsors: ask them whether they'd like to sponsor a particular session? or a particular talk which is relevant to their industry.
