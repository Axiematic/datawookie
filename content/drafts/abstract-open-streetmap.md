	Getting Lost with OpenStreetMap
	</div>
	<div class="abstract">
	It's hard to resist panning and zooming on an interactive map. You can literally get lost while vicariously exploring an interesting location.

	OpenStreetMap makes it simple to include interactive maps in websites and apps. And this service is free and open!

	But rendering maps is only the beginning. I'll tell you about other useful things you can do with the OpenStreetMap data. The talk will focus on three ideas, each of which will be illustrated with compelling visualisations. I'll show you the basic code that you need to make it happen, and provide pointers to where you can dig deeper. I'll also drop some useful tips on how to make the process quicker, easier and more effective.
