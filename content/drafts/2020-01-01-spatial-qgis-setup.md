## Snapping

Probably the most important setting when you are digitising is enabling snapping. <!-- more --> This allows you to cleanly define adjacent regions, avoiding potential gaps. Go to **Settings | Snapping Options**. You can choose to snap to vertex, segment or both. I like the last option. The tolerance is a matter of taste, but 10 pixels works well for me.
