Isaac Newton is widely considered to be one of the most influential scientists of all time. In a letter dated 1676 to his contemporary and rival, Robert Hooke, Newton wrote &#8220;If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&#8221; Although there are multiple interpretations of this statement, I prefer to think that Newton was acknowledging that many of his achievements (which were legion!) would have been impossible without the contributions of others.

So, much of Newton&#8217;s work was, in a sense, derivative. And if that&#8217;s good enough for Isaac Newton, then it&#8217;s certainly good enough for me!

## Reinventing the Wheel

No doubt everyone has at some time or another been admonished with &#8220;Don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel!&#8221; But why not? Why shouldn&#8217;t you reinvent? If you can make even a small improvement in something that is widely used, then the potential for cumulative benefits is enormous.

Small, incremental enhancements, where each one forms a foundation for the next, are completely worthwhile. It&#8217;s precisely the way that so many pervasive technologies have developed. It&#8217;s evolution in action.

## Google Didn&#8217;t Invent the Search Engine

If you were born during the 21st century you might be forgiven for thinking that Google invented the Search Engine. However, this is just not true. Google is simply one of the recent (albeit most successful) realisations of a technology that stretches all the way back to the birth of the internet. Early Search Engines included the [Archie Query Form][2], [Excite][3] and [AltaVista][4]. What differentiates Google from the other Search Engines is the PageRank algorithm invented by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Now I don&#8217;t want to detract from the ingenuity of Page and Brin, but they were in a priviledged position, metaphorically standing on the shoulders of giants. They could focus their attention on the link analysis algorithm because most of the other technology that goes into making a Search Engine had already been invented.

## Music: Fertile Ground for Reinvention

When I was young I had a peculiar passion for the music of Billy Joel. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the melodic chorus from [This Night][5] was based on the second movement from Beethoven&#8217;s [Path√©tique Sonata][6] (the second movement starts at around 09:45, if you&#8217;re impatient).

[Gloria Jones][7] (1964)

[Softcell][8] (1981)

[Marilyn Manson][9] (2001)

[Robert Hazard][10] (1979)

[Cyndi Lauper][11] (1983)

[Greg Laswell][12] (2007)

## Final Thoughts

So, I&#8217;ll conclude with three thoughts:

1.
  
2. Remember that Derivative is not a Dirty Word.
  
3. Be promiscuously (yet selectively) derivative. Benefit from the many great minds that have gone before you (and indeed, are probably sitting around you), feed off their ideas and innovations to create innovations of your own.
