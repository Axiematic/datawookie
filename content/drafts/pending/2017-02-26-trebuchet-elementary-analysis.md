If the projectile is launched with initial speed $latex v_0$ and an angle $latex \psi$ to the horizontal then it will achieve a range of

$latex R = \displaystyle \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin \psi \cos \psi}{g}$

where $latex g$ is gravitational acceleration. A short burst of Calculus will show that, for fixed $latex v_0$, maximum range is achieved when the launch angle is $latex \psi = \pi/4$.

The projectile would possess kinetic energy

$latex T\_m = \displaystyle \frac{m v\_0^2}{2}$

while the initial potential energy of the counterweight was

$latex V\_M = M g [(L\_1 + L\_2) \cos \theta &#8211; L\_4].$

Ideally all of the counterweight&#8217;s potential energy would be transferred to the projecticle, so that the optimal range would become

$latex R = \displaystyle \frac{2 M}{m} [(L\_1 + L\_2) \cos \theta &#8211; L_4].$

The range thus increases with larger counterweight masses and smaller projectile masses. Furthermore, the higher the counterweight is lifted, the further the projectile will go. Interestingly the range is independent of gravitational acceleration.
