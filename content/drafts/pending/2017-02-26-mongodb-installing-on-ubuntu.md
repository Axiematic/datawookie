These instructions pertain to Ubuntu 16.04.

[code language=&#8221;bash&#8221; gutter=&#8221;false&#8221;]
  
$ sudo apt install mongodb mongodb-server mongodb-clients
  


The system should have been started during the installation process. You can easily check that the service is running:

[code language=&#8221;bash&#8221; gutter=&#8221;false&#8221;]
  
$ service mongodb status
