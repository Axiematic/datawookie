	Working with Spatial Data in R: An Introduction

	<div class="abstract">
	Learning to work with Spatial Data in R can be challenging.

	In this workshop I'll give a gentle introduction to the key packages and show how they can be used to generate attractive and informative visualisations. I'll help you scramble over the first peak in the learning curve and get onto the plateau of productivity.

	We'll be working from a set of script templates, so it will be easy for everybody to keep up. Only a very basic proficiency with R will be assumed and I'll provide some reading material before the workshop so that everybody has the necessary background before we start.
