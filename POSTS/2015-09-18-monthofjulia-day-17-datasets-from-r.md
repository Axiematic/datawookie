R has an extensive range of builtin datasets, which are useful for experimenting with the language. The `RDatasets` package makes many of these available within Julia. We'll see another way of accessing R's datasets in a couple of days' time too. In the meantime though, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/RDatasets.jl) for `RDatasets` and then read on below.

As always, the first thing that we need to do is load the package.

We can get a list of the R packages which are supported by `RDatasets`.

Finally, the most interesting bit: accessing data from a particular dataset. Below we load up the `women` dataset from the `vcd` package.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> women = dataset("datasets", "women")

| 5   | 62     | 126    |
| 6   | 63     | 129    |
| 7   | 64     | 132    |

| 12  | 69     | 150    |
| 13  | 70     | 154    |

| 15  | 72     | 164    |

From these data we learn that the average mass of American women of height 66 inches is around 139 pounds. If you are from a country which uses the Metric system (like me!) then these numbers might seem a little mysterious. Come back in a couple of days and we'll see how Julia can convert pounds and inches in metres and kilograms.

That's all for now. Code for today is available on [github](https://github.com/DataWookie/MonthOfJulia).
