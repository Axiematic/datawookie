There are a number of Comrades Marathon qualifiers in the first quarter of the year. If you live in KwaZulu-Natal then it's likely that you'll be thinking about either the Hillcrest Marathon or the 'Maritzburg Marathon, which normally occur a couple of weeks apart during February.

The general feeling is that Hillcrest is a tougher race and that if you are chasing a particular time to ensure a place in a Comrades starting bin then your chances are better at 'Maritzburg.

That's the conventional wisdom. Let's see what the data have to say.

But before we get our hands dirty with data, let's review some anecdotal evidence.

## Anecdotal Evidence

I polled a few experienced runners and got their take on the Hillcrest versus 'Maritzburg question.

### Yvette

Yvette identified the following factors in favour of Hillcrest:

- easy to get to, so no early start; *Presuming that you live in the Durban area.*
- double lapper (which you know I love); *Not sure if this is an ironic statement?*
- nice support on the route.

She also mentioned these factors which count against Hillcrest:

- hilly;
- the laps can be split into two distinct sections (downhill and then uphill);
- very little relief on the course for your legs;
- hard course to maintain a pace;
- I drink too much beer after this race. *I don't think we can hold the race accountable for that!*

Similar, factors in favour of 'Maritzburg:

- nice route, undulating with some climbs but all doable and spread around the course;
- double lapper;
- fast finish home in case you are chasing a time (except that stupid incline past the school);
- You can maintain a nice pace throughout the run.

And, finally, a few things counting against 'Maritzburg:

- can be hot as hell; *Won't argue with that, although Hillcrest can be steamy too!*
- very early start if you don’t stay up there;
- takes the whole weekend if you are staying up there;
- I always think the course is easy, but it's not.

### Olly

Hi Andrew,
 
Flip, not sure exactly what to tell you, I’m a fan of both the Hillcrest and the Maritzburg Marathon and both have played a key part in my Comrades training. They are both double lappers which I like, knowing what to expect for the second loop. I have run a faster Maritzburg (3:16) versus a Hillcrest (around 3:28 I think?) but I really gave the Maritzburg Marathon a real crack back then – my running ambitions have somewhat lowered since then! The key difference between the two is the last 7 or so kilometres – the tougher finish up Old Main Road at the Hillcrest compared to a fast finish at the Maritzburg Marathon. So if I had to choose, I would say perhaps the Maritzburg Marathon would be more conducive to a faster marathon simply based on the positioning of the climbs and at what stage of the marathon they appear. Both events are brilliantly organised.
 
If my training goes well, the annual plan is to qualify at the Hillcrest with a “C-Batch” sub-3:40 (running even splits) and then run a “comfortable”sub-4 hour at the Maritzburg Marathon two weeks later (also even splits).
 
Cheers,
Olly

### Karl

I enjoy both marathons, they are both relatively close to home and both manageable marathons for a novice.

Personally Hillcrest is nicer because as a Pinetown resident there is less distance to travel for the marathon(unless I sleep in PMB) and slightly more sleeping time.

I would say though in my experience that Hillcrest is tougher, the last 10 km hilly climb back to the finish is probably the main reason.

That being said there is a lot that can be done with all the down in km’s 21 to 31.

If needed one can recover for the ups there after. If feeling strong one can make some very good time in this stretch too.

PMB is an undulating run with a few considerable hills, but most of these well over before the end of the race.

My faster time has been in PMB though, sub 4 mat to mat (4:01 gun to gun) as compared to 4:07 in Hillcrest.

Peruse Karl's results [here](https://www.racently.com/athlete/f67d193f-cd3d-4d22-be25-8a86789cef04/).

Let's do a quick two sample t-test.

{% highlight r %}
> t.test(maritzburg$time, hillcrest$time)

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  maritzburg$time and hillcrest$time
t = 2.12, df = 14800, p-value = 0.034
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.086866 2.183169
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
   257.55    256.42
{% endhighlight %}

The result is significant. But what's this? It indicates that times at Hillcrest are significantly (statistically!) faster than 'Maritzburg. That flies in the face of all expectations!

{% highlight r %}
> t.test(merged$maritzburg, merged$hillcrest, paired = TRUE)

	Paired t-test

data:  merged$maritzburg and merged$hillcrest
t = -8.94, df = 2650, p-value <2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -4.4480 -2.8474
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
                -3.6477
