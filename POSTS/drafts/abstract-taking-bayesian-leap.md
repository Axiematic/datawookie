Bayesian techniques can seem challenging and esoteric. However, they promise a powerful alternative to frequentist statistics, with the possibility of extracting even more useful information from your data.

This talk will help you get started with Bayesian analyses.

	Taking the Bayesian Leap (with R)

	<div class="abstract">
What are the minimum things you need to know to start applying Bayesian techniques in R? This talk will provide an entry level discussion covering the following topics:

- What can Bayes do for me? (A brief introduction to Bayesian methods)
- What is [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/)? (Writing models in Stan)
- Using Stan in R. (Using the [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/vignettes/rstan.html) package)

The talk will be peppered with useful tips for dealing with the initial challenges of using Stan.
