What are the minimum things you need to know to start applying Bayesian techniques in R? This talk will provide an entry level discussion covering the following topics:

- What can Bayes do for me? (A brief introduction to Bayesian methods)
- What is [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/)? (Writing models in Stan)
- Using Stan in R. (Using the [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/vignettes/rstan.html) package)

The talk will be peppered with useful tips for dealing with the initial challenges of using Stan.
