In terms of code, we've learned that people don't all benefit from an entire talk consisting of only code demos. Some of us love it, but some think it's boring or hard to follow. Mixing it up with tips, architecture patterns, output examples, and links to futher programming resources makes a good, balanced technical proposal.

	There are so many tools available for building maps, ranging in complexity from plain and simple to outrageously elaborate. The maps they produce can be static or interactive, overlaid on a satellite image, include labelled points of interest and routing information... The scope for variation and innovation is vast!

	With such a diversity of tools, it's never been easier to make a map. But, as Steve Jobs said, "tools are just tools". What do you need to know to use those tools effectively?

	In A Layman's Guide to Cartography I'll lay out three important principles which will help you leverage mapping tools to create aesthetically pleasing and informative maps. Using examples and a smattering of code I'll demonstrates how to put these principles into practice.

	Soon you'll be making maps like Mercator!
