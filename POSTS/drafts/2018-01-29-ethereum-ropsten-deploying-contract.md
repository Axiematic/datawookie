This illustrates how to deploy a contract onto the Ropsten (test) blockchain:

This will set up a local node on the Ropsten test network.

{% highlight text %}
$ geth --testnet
{% endhighlight %}







Until now we have been testing our contract on a lightweight local node hosted by testrpc. It's time to get an idea of how it will perform on a real blockchain. But we probably don't want to commit to the real Ethereum blockchain just yet. Fortunately there is a middle ground: public test networks. We'll be using the Ropsten network. There are alternatives to Ropsten, like [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/).

## Create an Account

Before you can deploy a contract, you'll need to first [create an account]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-26-ethereum-ropsten-create-account %}) on Ropsten. After you've created an account you'll be able to see it listed in the Truffle console.

{% highlight text %}
truffle(development)> web3.eth.accounts
[ '0x0304bdbda48208ef3cccb9dffecf4d14ab6481b0' ]
{% endhighlight %}

Check that the account is funded. It's going to cost Ether to deploy our contract.

{% highlight text %}
truffle(development)> web3.eth.getBalance('0x0304bdbda48208ef3cccb9dffecf4d14ab6481b0')
{ [String: '5000000000000000000'] s: 1, e: 18, c: [ 50000 ] }
{% endhighlight %}

## Unlock the Account

Unlock the account.

{% highlight text %}
truffle(development)> web3.personal.unlockAccount('0x0304bdbda48208ef3cccb9dffecf4d14ab6481b0', '(Frye}dbpfAc2', 15000)
true
{% endhighlight %}

## Migrating the Contract

{% highlight bash %}
$ truffle migrate
{% endhighlight %}

This will take a short while. Long enough to check your email; too quick to make a coffee.
