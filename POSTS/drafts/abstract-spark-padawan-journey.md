	Spark: A Padawan's Journey
	</div>
	<div class="abstract">
	<p>Spark is a powerful compute engine. It provides a fault-tolerant, high level interface to handle parallel tasks involving large volumes of data across entire clusters.</p>
	<p>This talk follows my journey as a Spark Padawan. There are trials and tribulations. There are also moments of triumph and glory.</p>
	<p>There will be a broad introduction to the following core topics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs);</li>
		<li> DataFrames and Datasets;</li>
		<li> using the Machine Learning Library (MLlib); and</li>
		<li> accessing Spark from Python and R.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I'll be sharing tips, insights and resources which will be helpful for other Padawans on their own Spark journey.</p>
