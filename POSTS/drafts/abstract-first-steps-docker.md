	First Steps with Docker
	</div>
	<div class="abstract">
	<p>To the uninitiated Docker can seem like a frightening beast. But it's not really all that scary. Taming this animal will allow you to adopt a selection of strategies for streamlining the way that you compute.</p>

	<p>This talk will cover the following topics:</p>

	<ul>
	<li> What is Docker and why should I care?</li>
	<li> Images and Containers</li>
	<li> Building your first image</li>
	<li> Launching your first container</li>
	<li> Interacting with live containers</li>
	<li> <code>Dockerfile</code> syntax</li>
	<li> Sharing data with a container</li>
	<li> Exposing ports from a container</li>
	<li> Orchestrating multiple containers</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These concepts will be stepping stones to building and deploying a simple app with a MySQL data store and served by NGINX. However they also act as a gateway to exploring the wide range of other functionality available through Docker.</p>
