In VirtualBox go to File -> Import Appliance. Select the file that you downloaded.

When you try to start the new image you might get the following error. This suggests that you'll need to tweak your BIOS.

In addition to the error above, you might also have noted that you were only able to specify 32 bit versions of the operating system.

Both of these issues can be resolved by rebooting your machine and enabling suitable virtualisation options in your BIOS. You can read more about this issue [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/308937/cannot-install-ubuntu-in-virtualbox-due-to-this-kernel-requires-an-x86-64-cpu). Once you've done that you should be able to select a 64 bit operating system and you shouldn't see the error dialog again.

You might also be prompted to modify the base memory for the image.
