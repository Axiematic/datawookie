It seems a little surreal that it&#8217;s be more than a year since I completed my [#MonthOfJulia][1] project. About time for another month of learning, and the first day of a new year is as good a time as any to start. This time around I&#8217;ll be looking at [Django][2]. To be honest I&#8217;ve been working with Django for almost a year already now, but I&#8217;m painfully aware that there&#8217;s so much more to learn. So some of my daily entries will be fleshing out things that I&#8217;ve already learned, while others will be documenting fresh learnings.

## Online Resources

## Books

  * [Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.8][3] (Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfeld): Written in a rather unorthodox style, this book is packed with highly distilled Django content. 
      * [Lightweight Django: Using REST, WebSockets, and Backbone][4] (Julia Elman and Mark Lavin) 
          * [High Performance Django][5] (Peter Baumgartner and Yann Malet) 
              * [Django by Example Paperback][6] (Antonio Mel&eacute;) 
                  * [Django Design Patterns and Best Practices][7] (Arun Ravindran) 
                      * [Learning Django Web Development][8] (Sanjeev Jaiswal and Ratan Kumar) </ul> 
                        ## Videos
                        
                        There are a couple of great video courses in the [CodingEntrepreneurs][9] channel:
                        
                          * [Try Django 1.8 &#8211; Create an MVP Landing Page][10] 
                              * [Try Django 1.9 &#8211; Build a Django Blog][11] </ul> 
                                There are a number of other relevant videos in this channel, so well worth rummaging around.
