title: Swing Alert Indicator
---

I've just finished coding a swing alert indicator for a client. The rules are rather straightforward and it all depends on two simple moving averages (by default with periods of 25 and 5). <!--more--> The indicator generates alerts via

* email,
* popup window and
* sound.

Below is an image of the indicator in action. The signals still require some trader discretion as to whether or not they are valid, but it certainly alerts every time there is potential for a trade.
