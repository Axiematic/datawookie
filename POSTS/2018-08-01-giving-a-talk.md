## Mechanics of Working with Slides

### Blank Screen

Use keyboard shortcuts (<kbd>B</kbd> for black and <kbd>W</kbd> for white) to blank out the projector and get the focus of the audience entirely on you.

## Presentation Persona

When you get up on the stage, remember that your job is to entertain and inform. To accomplish the former you need to get yourself into the mindset of an entertainer.

You need to be excited about your topic and you need to convey this excitement to your audience. If you're not excited then you probably shouldn't be giving this talk.

## Tell a Story

To keep the attention of the audience you need to tell a story. There should be a continuous narrative that runs through the course of your talk.

What makes a good story?

- Conflict.
	* Resolving a problem.
	* Trial and error.
	* Struggle against adversity.
	* Opposing forces.
- Contrast (similar to conflict: Big versus Small; Right versus Left; Old versus Young.)

## Transitions

Perhaps the trickiest parts of giving a good talk are the transitions between subjects and slides. If these are not done right then the whole thing ends up being a collection of isolated snippets rather than an integrated whole. Practicing these changes can smoothe out the transitions, making them appear seemless.

## Plant Friendly Faces in the Audience

In the days and hours leading up to the talk make sure that you connect with many people at the conference. Tell them what you will be talking about and encourage them to attend your talk. Having these faces as anchor points in the audience is really helpful in creating a connection. Once you gain some momentum you'll find that you are engaging with more people. But it's good to have existing rapport with at least a few people.

## Tickle Their Funny Bone

It doesn't have to be funny but it should be fun. Your audience should be enjoying themselves!

- Can you poke fun at something which is perceived to be difficult or boring?
- Find a couple of funny or unusual words. Use them repeatedly.
- Use irony.
- Use hyperbole. Exaggeration can be very amusing.
- Be (a little) self-deprocating.
- Leverage the unexpected. A surprise is often funny. Saying something that the audience is not expecting can be very effective. Create an expectation and then violate it.

## Stick To Time

Even if everybody else is talking beyond their allocated time, don't be a lemming. Respect the audience and their (precious) time. Finish on time. Keep careful track of the time and adjust your pace appropriately. If you sense that you are going too slowly then make the decision to omit a few slides.

## Wrapping It Up

### Don't Say "Thank You!"

It's become a bit of a clich√© to conclude a talk by saying "Thank you!". Differentiate yourself by finding another way to sign off.

So what are your alternatives?

### Present a Strong Call to Action

What do you want the people in the audience to do immediately after you finish giving your talk? Tell them what they should do to take the first step.

### Solicit Feedback

Provide contact details at the end of your talk and encourage them to contact you with feedback or to learn more about the topic.
