[Sudoku-as-a-Service](http://iaindunning.com/blog/sudoku-as-a-service.html) is a great illustration of Julia's integer programming facilities. Julia has several packages which implement various flavours of optimisation: [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl), [JuMPeR](https://github.com/IainNZ/JuMPeR.jl), [Gurobi](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Gurobi.jl), [CPLEX](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/CPLEX.jl), [DReal](https://github.com/dreal/dReal.jl), [CoinOptServices](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/CoinOptServices.jl) and [OptimPack](https://github.com/emmt/OptimPack.jl). We're not going to look at anything quite as elaborate as Sudoku today, but focus instead on finding the extrema in some simple (or perhaps not so simple) mathematical functions. At this point you might find it interesting to browse through this catalog of [test functions for optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization).

## Optim

We'll start out by using the [Optim](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Optim.jl) package to find extrema in [Himmelblau's function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himmelblau%27s_function):

$$ f(x, y) = (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2. $$

This function has one maximum and four minima. One of the minima is conveniently located at

$$ (x, y) = (3, 2). $$

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/2015/09/800px-Himmelblau_function.svg.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Himmelblau_function.svg)

As usual the first step is to load the required package.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> using Optim
{{< / highlight >}}

Then we set up the objective function along with its gradient and Hessian functions.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> function himmelblau(x::Vector)
           (x[1]^2 + x[2] - 11)^2 + (x[1] + x[2]^2 - 7)^2
       end
himmelblau (generic function with 1 method)
julia> function himmelblau_gradient!(x::Vector, gradient::Vector)
           gradient[1] = 4 \* x[1] \* (x[1]^2 + x[2] - 11) + 2 * (x[1] + x[2]^2 - 7)
           gradient[2] = 2 \* (x[1]^2 + x[2] - 11) + 4 \* x[2] * (x[1] + x[2]^2 - 7)
       end
himmelblau_gradient! (generic function with 1 method)
julia> function himmelblau_hessian!(x::Vector, hessian::Matrix)
           hessian[1, 1] = 4 \* (x[1]^2 + x[2] - 11) + 8 \* x[1]^2 + 2
           hessian[1, 2] = 4 \* x[1] + 4 \* x[2]
           hessian[2, 1] = 4 \* x[1] + 4 \* x[2]
           hessian[2, 2] = 4 \* (x[1] + x[2]^2 - 7) + 8 \* x[2]^2 + 2
       end
himmelblau_hessian! (generic function with 1 method)

There are a number of algorithms at our disposal. We'll start with the [Nelder Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method) method which only uses the objective function itself. I am very happy with the detailed output provided by the `optimize()` function and clearly it converges on a result which is very close to what we expected.

{{< highlight julia >}}

   * |g(x)| < NaN: false
   * Exceeded Maximum Number of Iterations: false

Next we'll look at the [limited-memory version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS) of the [BFGS algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm). This can be applied either with or without an explicit gradient function. In this case we'll provide the gradient function defined above. Again we converge on the right result, but this time with far fewer iterations required.

   * |g(x)| < 1.0e-08: true
   * Exceeded Maximum Number of Iterations: false
 * Objective Function Calls: 25
 * Gradient Call: 25

Finally we'll try out [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization), where we'll provide both gradient and Hessian functions. The result is spot on and we've shaved off one iteration. Very nice indeed!

   * |g(x)| < 1.0e-08: true

 * Objective Function Calls: 19
 * Gradient Call: 19

There is also a [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) solver in the Optim package.

## NLopt

[NLopt](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Reference) is an optimisation library with interfaces for a variety of programming languages. NLopt offers a variety of optimisation [algorithms](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Algorithms). We'll apply both a gradient-based and a derivative-free technique to maximise the function

$$ \sin\alpha \cos\beta $$

subject to the constraints

$$ 2 \alpha \leq \beta $$

and

$$ \beta \leq \pi/2. $$

Before we load the NLopt package, it's a good idea to restart your Julia session to flush out any remnants of the Optim package.

We'll need to write the objective function and a generalised constraint function.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> count = 0;
julia> function objective(x::Vector, grad::Vector)
			if length(grad) > 0
				grad[1] = cos(x[1]) * cos(x[2])
				grad[2] = - sin(x[1]) * sin(x[2])
			end

			global count
			count::Int += 1
			println("Iteration $count: $x")

			sin(x[1]) * cos(x[2])
		end
objective (generic function with 1 method)
julia> function constraint(x::Vector, grad::Vector, a, b, c)
			if length(grad) > 0
				grad[1] = a
				grad[2] = b
			end
			a * x[1] + b * x[2] - c
		end
constraint (generic function with 1 method)

The [COBYLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBYLA) (Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximations) algorithm is a local optimiser which doesn't use the gradient function.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> opt = Opt(:LN_COBYLA, 2); 						# Algorithm and dimension of problem
julia> ndims(opt)
2
julia> algorithm(opt)
:LN_COBYLA
julia> algorithm_name(opt) 								# Text description of algorithm
"COBYLA (Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximations) (local, no-derivative)"
{{< / highlight >}}

We impose generous upper and lower bounds on the solution space and use two inequality constraints. Either `min_objective!()` or `max_objective!()` is used to specify the objective function and whether or not it is a minimisation or maximisation problem. Constraints can be either inequalities using `inequality_constraint!()` or equalities using `equality_constraint!()`.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> lower_bounds!(opt, [0., 0.])
julia> upper_bounds!(opt, [pi, pi])
julia> xtol_rel!(opt, 1e-6)
julia> max_objective!(opt, objective)

julia> inequality_constraint!(opt, (x, g) -> constraint(x, g, 0, 2, pi), 1e-8)

After making an initial guess we let the algorithm loose. I've purged some of the output to spare you from the floating point deluge.

It takes a number of iterations to converge, but arrives at a solution which seems eminently reasonable (and which satisfies both of the constraints).

Next we'll use the MMA (Method of Moving Asymptotes) gradient-based algorithm.

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> opt = Opt(:LD_MMA, 2);
{{< / highlight >}}

We remove the second inequality constraint and simply confine the solution space appropriately. This is definitely a more efficient approach!

{{< highlight julia >}}
julia> lower_bounds!(opt, [0., 0.])
julia> upper_bounds!(opt, [pi, pi / 2])
julia> xtol_rel!(opt, 1e-6)
julia> max_objective!(opt, objective)
julia> inequality_constraint!(opt, (x, g) -> constraint(x, g, 2, -1, 0), 1e-8)
{{< / highlight >}}

This algorithm converges more rapidly (because it takes advantage of the gradient function!) and we arrive at the same result.

I'm rather impressed. Both of these packages provide convenient interfaces and I could solve my test problems without too much effort. Have a look at the videos below for more about optimisation in Julia and check out [github](https://github.com/DataWookie/MonthOfJulia) for the complete code for today's examples. We'll kick off next week with a quick look at some alternative data structures.
